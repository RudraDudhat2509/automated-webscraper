Finding sustainability and opportunity in a dynamic landscape
What’s next in engineering and construction
Insight
9
                     minute read
January 09, 2025
The engineering and construction (E&C) sector continues to undergo significant transformation driven by policy, credits and incentives, as well as growing demand for clean energy. As global construction projections climb from US$10.2 trillion in 2020 to $15.2 trillion by 2030, the focus on sustainable infrastructure, supply chains and construction techniques is growing just as quickly.
For E&C firms, the pressure to deliver projects that meet their customers’ ambitious sustainability and net-zero goals is mounting. This shift isn’t just about regulatory compliance but also about setting the foundation for growth and long-term relevance. Backlog uncertainty and the potential shift away from sustainability priorities can further complicate the landscape. Owners that strive to balance sustainability and growth may find themselves prioritizing short-term financial stability over long-term net-zero commitments.
To thrive in this environment, E&C executives should consider integrating sustainability into their core business models while remaining flexible enough to adapt to fluctuating project demands and financial pressures. This involves carefully aligning growth and margin targets with firm capabilities and project backlog while, at the same time, enabling short-term decisions that don’t undermine long-term goals. With this approach, you can position your firm as an E&C leader capable of delivering on both economic and environmental fronts, even amid this uncertainty.
Finding opportunity amid political uncertainty
The reelection of Donald J. Trump signals both opportunities and challenges for the E&C sector. While the administration may focus on deregulation and hydro-carbon fuel expansion — potentially curtailing financial credits and incentives that prioritize renewable investments — it also aims to create a balanced energy landscape. This approach could level the playing field for various energy sources, providing options to meet growing energy demands while balancing costs and competitiveness with sustainability goals. Until these policy decisions are clearer, this optionality will continue to contribute to backlog uncertainty.
However, existing legislation — such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) — provide a foundation for ongoing emission reductions and climate protection efforts. Bipartisan support exists for clean energy development, next-generation geothermal energy and decarbonizing heavy industries. Even oil and gas stalwarts have shown support for certain provisions of the IRA, indicating a broad recognition of the economic and environmental benefits of certain clean energy initiatives.
Current policies also include environmental credits tied to carbon reduction and renewable energy initiatives, creating opportunities for firms to explore innovative solutions in emissions management and offsetting. Additionally, the decommissioning of older, less-efficient infrastructure is emerging as one of the key areas for firms to support clients in meeting sustainability and efficiency standards.
As policy-driven investments reshape the energy landscape, E&C firms should stay agile and build new capabilities to capitalize on emerging opportunities. This includes balancing policy-driven incentives with the industry’s ability to develop sustainable innovations and collaborating with the technology sector to implement advanced tools for emissions tracking, project optimization and carbon reporting.
An important factor in the current energy landscape is determining the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), which measures the average cost of generating electricity over an asset’s lifetime. Traditionally, hydrocarbon fuels, including natural gas, have had lower LCOEs due to established supply chains, infrastructure and technology. But the LCOE for renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and nuclear has been decreasing significantly, driven by technological advancements and economies of scale, making renewables increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources even without subsidies.
To effectively manage these challenges amid the uncertainties of future energy demands, contractors should remain flexible and prepared to develop power generation infrastructure using abundant resources like natural gas, wind and solar energy that provide reliable and cost-effective solutions for the energy sector. Additionally, small modular reactors (SMRs) are also gaining recognition as viable alternatives. As these traditional energy sources are utilized, solar, battery and wind developers should enhance their competitiveness, speed to market and adaptability to meet the increasing demand for clean energy.
At the same time, tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could complicate supply chains, increasing lead times and challenges for firms dependent on cross-border operations, until the US manufacturing base catches up with demand. Plans to impose up to 25% tariffs on Mexico- and China-origin goods could impact costs and sourcing strategies for E&C companies. Companies reliant on
‘maquiladora’ operations
— manufacturing facilities in Mexico that process imported materials for export — or imported materials may face immediate financial and operational disruptions. To prepare for this uncertainty, E&C firms should proactively
model the financial and operational impacts of tariffs and explore mitigation strategies
. Redirecting sourcing to lower-impact regions, accelerating cost-reduction measures, and integrating tax and trade strategies can be important for resilience.
Bipartisan support exists for clean energy development, next-generation geothermal energy and decarbonizing heavy industries.
Responding to the challenge: 6 key considerations
1. Go nuclear: Integration of renewable energy sources
Some E&C firms are capitalizing on the growing demand for renewable energy solutions to meet the high, continuous power demands of such sectors as manufacturing, transportation and data centers. These facilities require a steady, large-scale power supply to enable continuous operation and reliability, which traditional renewable energy sources like solar and wind often struggle to provide without effective advanced storage options.
Nuclear energy, particularly SMRs, offers a viable pathway to bridge this gap. E&C firms that are adding capabilities related to nuclear-based infrastructure projects to meet the unique energy demands of data centers sustainably are positioning themselves to address an important need in a rapidly growing sector. Additionally, investing in these capabilities can open to expanded business relationships and opportunities in data center design and build.
2. Seize incentives: Policy-driven investments
The IRA and the BIL provide significant financial incentives and investments in green energy projects, offering E&C firms opportunities to engage in large-scale infrastructure improvements and climate-focused initiatives.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
allocates $1.2 trillion to improve power grid resilience, mass transit, broadband and water systems, while the IRA offers up to $660 billion in tax incentives for domestic energy production and climate-focused initiatives. From an owner’s perspective, E&C firms are important to achieving their sustainability goals. Failure to achieve certain project-specific performance goals (labor force, procurement sourcing, schedule mandates, etc.) could result in an owner forfeiting as much as 50% in credits and incentives, which are often key to making sustainable projects economically viable.
These policies are helping drive significant investments across energy and technology sectors, requiring companies to stay nimble and build new capabilities to capitalize on these opportunities effectively. A strong team that understands requirements for full incentive recovery and customer data will provide opportunities for differentiation from competitors and more project wins. Bipartisan efforts like the Carbon Removal and Emission Storage Technologies Act, the Concrete Asphalt Innovation Act and the Providing Reliable, Objective, Verifiable Emissions Intensity and Transparency Act aim to decarbonize key industrial sectors, advance clean energy, and enhance US competitiveness in a lower-carbon global marketplace. Support for nuclear energy, critical minerals and streamlined clean energy permitting further highlights opportunities for innovation and job creation. Despite political uncertainty, these initiatives signal the potential for continued climate progress and investment in sustainable solutions. Adapting to the shifting energy landscape involves balancing policy-driven incentives with the industry’s ability to develop sustainable innovations. E&C firms should align their strategies to stay resilient and responsive as energy markets adjust to a broader range of supported energy sources.
3. Drive digital innovation: Harnessing emerging technologies
Embracing emerging digital technologies has become critical for driving operational efficiency and supporting sustainable project delivery for E&C firms. Early adopters gain a competitive advantage by integrating these integrations into their workflows, enabling them to improve design, construction and maintenance processes while contributing to long-term sustainability goals.
Digital twin technology
, for example, has revolutionized the way physical assets and processes are modeled and managed. By creating virtual replicas of real-world environments, firms can simulate and analyze performance, predict maintenance needs and enhance operations with unprecedented precision. These virtual models, when combined with advanced building information modeling (BIM), integrate cost and life-cycle management attributes, facilitating smarter decision-making throughout a project’s life cycle.
AI and machine learning (ML) are also reshaping traditional workflows, offering predictive insights and improving risk management. From enabling advanced engineering designs and to enhancing complex construction schedules,
AI-driven solutions
are helping firms identify patterns and anticipate potential snags, enabling project completion on time and within budget.
Technologies like drones and 3D printing are redefining on-site operations. Drones enhance safety by conducting aerial surveys, monitoring progress and inspecting quality, while 3D printing enables rapid prototyping and creation of customized components with reduced material waste.
Meanwhile, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are transforming stakeholder engagement and workforce training. By providing immersive design visualizations and realistic simulations of complex tasks, these tools bridge the gap between concept and execution, enhancing collaboration and helping reduce risks.
Incorporating robotics and wearable technology further elevates workforce productivity and safety. Robotic systems help with physically demanding tasks, while exoskeletons enhance worker endurance and help reduce the risk of injury.
Together, these technological innovations are propelling the E&C industry into an era of enterprise transformation.

By collaborating with technology partners, E&C firms are integrating AI solutions that streamline operations, improve resource allocation, predict project outcomes and performance, enhance bid success rates and tackle sustainability challenges, enabling project backlog certainty and investment in high-impact outcomes. These collaborations also bolster emissions tracking and reporting, driving long-term value through advanced analytics and machine learning.
To further differentiate, E&C firms should focus on building strong, flexible supply chain capabilities. Investing in low-carbon and sustainable options by digitizing supply chain processes enhances visibility, anticipates disruptions and enables real-time adjustments. Collaboration with suppliers improves operational efficiency and helps reduce uncertainty in lead-times, costs and quality.
Additionally, cybersecurity remains essential to protect against third-party threats, safeguarding the integrity of digital tools and data used in emissions tracking and reporting.
Tackling these issues can help your E&C firm build differentiated capabilities that enhance competitiveness.
6. Upskill and maintain your workforce: Culture of sustainability and innovation
The E&C sector continues to face a significant challenge with skilled labor shortages, particularly as the demand for sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy and data center projects continues to grow. According to
PwC’s August 2023 Pulse Survey
, 71% of industrial products leaders say talent acquisition and employee retention present serious or moderate risks to their business. This shortage is exacerbated by an aging workforce, a decline in new entrants into apprenticeship programs and resistance to change. Trades, including electricians, welders and pipefitters, are experiencing some of the largest gaps, which could hinder the sector’s ability to meet ambitious project timelines and sustainability goals.
To address these shortages, E&C firms should prioritize recruiting, training and investing in apprenticeship programs. Developing strong apprenticeship pathways is essential to attract young talent and provide them with the necessary skills to prosper in the industry. Additionally, upskilling the existing workforce is crucial to confirm that new entrants are equipped with institutional knowledge and techniques as well as emerging sustainable construction practices.
AI may offer an opportunity to boost productivity without directly replacing workers by handling such tasks as estimating takeoffs, engineering drawing review and identifying jobsite hazards. By serving as an automated assistant, AI can help apprentices, skilled craftsman and experienced decision-makers through the learning curve while performing tasks more efficiently with fewer errors.
However, driving this change may be a challenge. PwC’s
Global Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey 2024
found that that more than half of respondents feel there’s too much change at work happening at once, and 44% don’t understand why things need to change at all. At the same time, workers report increased workloads, uncertainty about job security and pervasive financial struggles.
Investing in workforce development not only helps bridge the skills gap but fosters a culture of sustainability and innovation. By offering flexible work options and creating clear career growth pathways, E&C firms can attract and retain a diverse and motivated workforce, which is vital for driving future innovation and maintaining a competitive advantage.

Innovative Engineering Practices Transforming Modern Industries
Innovative Engineering Practices Transforming Modern Industries
07 Oct
Engineers spearhead new developments that are shaping our society. From advanced robotics to sustainable energy systems, mechanical engineers develop cutting-edge engineering methods to solve complex problems in design, production and sustainability.
This article will explore advances in engineering innovation that organizations use to facilitate progress.
AI and Machine Learning in Engineering Design
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies underpin many modern engineering techniques. They can accelerate mechanical engineering workflows for faster product development. For example, generative AI can create rapid prototypes based on specifications and data inputs. Mechanical engineers can then refine the designs based on AI models and performance information.
1
AI algorithms can improve product performance and functionality based on real-time and historical data. Incorporating real-time error detection can allow equipment to adapt and maintain itself. AI programs can also monitor equipment to determine when it needs preventative maintenance. This allows operators to optimize performance by servicing equipment before it breaks down, reducing downtime and lost revenue.
1
Mechanical engineers use AI to improve decision-making in product development. By analyzing virtual models or data from existing products, AI programs can suggest refinements to improve product design and decrease costs.
1
Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0
Modern history has seen four industrial revolutions, and mechanical engineers have been at the forefront of each one. The first was powered by water and steam. The second introduced assembly lines and oil, gas and electric energy. The third incorporated computers and telecommunications into the manufacturing process. The fourth, known as Industry 4.0 or smart manufacturing, is building on the progress of the first three by incorporating connected sensors that collect data to optimize all aspects of manufacturing.
2
Internet of Things (IoT)
Manufacturers are integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology, cloud computing and robotics into the manufacturing process. IoT sensors in equipment can collect data that can be analyzed and utilized for improved decision-making and real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
Business leaders can use sensor data to determine when machines need proactive maintenance. This allows them to service equipment before it malfunctions and causes unanticipated downtime. By creating a network of interconnected equipment and products, manufacturers can optimize production processes, minimize waste and reduce costs.
2
Automation and Robotics
Automation and robotics are also major elements of smart manufacturing. Producing quality products in high-volume manufacturing relies on precision. Robots are capable of more precise and repetitive movements than humans, making them a valuable addition to manufacturing facilities. They can also work in hazardous conditions, reducing the danger to human workers. As robotic and automation capabilities continue to grow, workplaces of the future will feature a seamless integration of human and robotic workers.
3
Digital Twins
Digital twins are virtual models of equipment that mechanical engineers can use to simulate and optimize production. Sensors on the physical model collect data that's automatically transferred to the digital model. The model lasts throughout the product’s lifecycle and is updated in real time to accurately reflect the condition of the equipment. Engineers can use the digital copy to run tests and analyze performance. They can make changes to the digital twin and test it virtually to see if they can optimize its performance. Modeling these changes virtually before implementing them on the physical equipment is cheaper and easier. Engineers don't have to interrupt operations to run tests and make changes that may not be effective.
4
Edge Computing
Smart manufacturing is characterized by the massive amounts of data it produces. Although this is what underlies many capabilities, it also puts a strain on processing power. Cloud computing allows manufacturers to offload data storage and processing to remote data centers. While this saves time and money compared to handling these functions on-premises, it can slow down performance. Edge computing moves storage and processing applications closer to where the data is collected in a distributed network. If a manufacturer has several locations, it can use servers that are physically closer to each location. This reduces the time it takes for data to travel to servers, so engineers can achieve faster insights into the production process.
2
Sustainable Engineering Practices
Mechanical engineers are leading the effort to design energy-efficient systems and renewable energy technology. Sustainable engineering practices work to optimize efficiency while reducing environmental impact. Engineers are developing solar, wind and thermal energy projects to reduce carbon emissions and help reverse climate change. For example, Flexi-wings increase the efficiency of wind turbines by optimizing the pitch angle, which is the angle of the turbine blade in relation to the wind. Previously, wind turbines were only efficient if the wind was blowing at the perfect angle. Flexi-wings improve wind turbine efficiency by 35%.
5
Engineers contribute to a circular economy–a system designed to minimize waste by keeping resources in use as long as possible. Concrete is a good example of this in action. Bioconcrete and green concrete are designed to use biological materials in manufacturing. Bioconcrete incorporates bacteria that produce limestone. This allows it to self-heal by repairing its own cracks. Green concrete is manufactured using waste materials. It’s less expensive to produce while maintaining durability.
5
Advanced Simulation and Modeling Techniques
Simulation and modeling techniques allow engineers to design and optimize products virtually. Finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are both examples of computer-aided engineering. FEA simplifies complex models by breaking them down into smaller parts to mathematically model behavior. This allows engineers to conduct structural, thermal and vibrational analysis on products as well as predict future failure. CFD is used to solve fluid dynamics problems in aerodynamics, HVAC systems, combustion, chemical processing and biomedical applications.
6
These and other modeling and simulation programs can be used for virtual prototyping, testing, and validation. Producing physical prototypes is an expensive and cumbersome process. Virtual prototyping can cut down on the time and expense associated with creating viable products. Although virtual prototyping doesn’t completely eliminate physical models, it does move the process of creating physical prototypes to the later stages of the design cycle. By virtually prototyping earlier in the process, you can improve performance and reduce the cost of your design.
7
Advanced simulations aren’t just effective for design and prototyping. They’re also an effective method of analyzing equipment health and performance. Digital simulations, such as digital twins, allow engineers to design better models based on flaws in existing ones.

Inside the lab at Lunar Energy’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, applications engineers and industrial designers all share the same ""bench.""
Lunar Energy
I
t’s not easy being a startup when the team is split into two locations separated by an ocean—a hardware engineering base in California and a software engineering base in London. Despite this divide, employees at
Lunar Energy
, a clean energy startup that develops solar energy solutions to power homes, work cohesively—which is very much by design.
“A lot of companies look at statistics to fill employees, and you have recruiters that try to fill positions as quickly as possible,” says Ed Franklin, head of people at Lunar Energy, which was founded in 2020. “But [we] take our time with the people we hire.”
And once they’re onboard, those employees’ opinions are highly valued. Lunar Energy’s CEO Kunal Girotra regularly solicits employee feedback through Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions. He holds monthly meetings with senior executives to understand employee sentiment. The company even maintains an anonymous web-based feedback forum to gather employee intel.
“This is unusual in a startup,” says Franklin, who contends that while CEOs often focus on the product or funding, theirs prioritizes the company’s people and work culture. “He's not defensive about things that are constructive.”
Consider that until recently, several of the company’s engineering teams tasked with developing different products were siloed even though they were all working toward the same project: the company's Lunar System, an all-in-one energy system that enables homes to make, store and use clean energy through a combination of solar panels and electric batteries. But when employee feedback indicated that a lack of collaboration across the teams was hindering them from meeting their goals and deadlines, Girotra brought the engineering teams together under a new director, and promoted other employees to lead each project within the larger group.“It’s easy for a CEO to say, ‘we want this product to launch in 6 months,’” says Franklin. But at Lunar Energy, employees have a say in how and when that happens, “and it’s helped us hit milestones.” It has also helped Lunar Energy earn the No. 4 spot on our sixth-annual list of
America’s Best Startup Employers
.
To create this list,
Forbes
partnered with market research firm
Statista
to identify and assess 3,000 privately-held companies headquartered in the United States. To qualify for consideration, each company was required to employ more than 50 people, to have been founded between 2015 and 2022, and to be an independent business (not a spinoff of a larger corporation). Companies were evaluated on reputation, employee satisfaction, and growth, on the basis of millions of data points, to determine each company’s score. The 500 startups with the highest total scores made our final list. (For more on the methodology, see below.)
Employees at Anthropic—creator of GenAI assistant Claude—work in the San Francisco headquarters.
Anthropic
Several companies that fared well last year rose substantially on this year’s ranking, including:
Cribl
(No. 1, up from No. 6 last year), a data management company that serves the IT and security sector;
Wiz
(No. 8, up from No. 18), a
fast-growing cloud security company
; and
Hightouch
(No. 3, up from No. 9), a customer data and AI platform.
At No. 11 (up from No. 15),
Mill
, a startup with a mission to reduce food waste, makes its product—a sleek food recycler—the center of most company interactions. Mill devices, stuffed with items such as rotting eggs and garlic, are placed in shared company spaces, such as conference rooms, to field-test product designs and understand consumer pain points. Though maybe not a company for sensitive smellers, this method does help with employee bonding. “We really bring everyone in the company along for that journey,” says Emma Bright, Mill’s head of product design and engineering. She adds that such an in-your-nose experience drives employees to address customer concerns about odors, while not taking themselves too seriously—and “is fundamental to solving problems quickly.”
The company, founded in 2020, also hosts seasonally-themed, food-focused events and potlucks, and organizes a yearly retreat called Camp Mill—a several-day outing in a natural setting designed to reorient the team around the company’s climate-focused goal. Those retreats are not spent staring at laptop screens planning for the next quarter, but sharing skills and experiences—along with yoga and painting. Mill is far from the only startup putting its product front and center with employees.
At
Whatnot
(No. 6, up from No. 8) the staff uses the company’s product on a daily basis, all part of an effort to build “a lot of connection to our product, community and excitement about the future,” says Whatnot’s chief people officer Tess Singha. Whatnot, a livestream commerce platform founded in 2019, now boasts a
valuation of about $5 billion
.The company recently rolled out an in-person onboarding program that provides new employees with a complete introduction to Whatnot. The orientation includes learning about the company's founding story and plans for the future, and watching a seller go live on the commerce platform for the first time. The aim, Singha says, is to connect the dots from employee to the seller experience.
“We often host seller interviews during our weekly town hall meetings so every employee can learn about the seller’s journey on Whatnot, from how they use our product, [to] what inspires them and their aspirations for growing their business,” says Singha. The company also invests in the wellbeing of its employees by offering a weeklong, company-wide break in both the summer and the winter, generous parental leave and an allowance for employees to buy on the Whatnot platform—all on top of Whatnot’s competitive cash and equity compensation.
Sharing space atop this year’s rankings were some of the buzziest companies of the year—Generative AI platforms—which collectively received $56 billion dollars in venture capital in 2024, nearly
double the amount of VC funds raised by GenAI companies in 2023
.
Case in point:
Anthropic
, which landed at No. 7, is the maker of Claude, an AI-assistant similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. (
OpenAI
, arguably the most well-known of the AI startups, also made the list at No. 13.) Elevating Anthropic to that position were robust paid leave programs and family-forming benefits, relocation support, competitive salary and equity packages, a monthly wellness stipend and extensive mental health resources, including therapy and coaching sessions, says Hannah Pritchett, Anthropic’s head of people.
Less tangible but just as vital to employee happiness, says Pritchett, is a company culture where technical and ethical conversations happen in the same room. “We hire from academia, startups, Big Tech, policy—and what unites us is a shared mission: building AI systems that are not just powerful, but fundamentally safe and aligned with human values.”
And Anthropic employees don’t take this mission lightly. “Everyone carries both the excitement of pioneering new technological territory and the responsibility of doing so with extraordinary care,” says Pritchett. It’s certainly a sentiment shared by many of the worthy companies on this year’s list.

Methodology
To create America’s Best Startup Employers 2025,
Forbes
partnered with market research firm
Statista
to identify and assess 3,000 privately-held companies headquartered in the United States. To qualify for consideration, the startups were required to have more than 50 employees, to have been founded between 2015 and 2022, and to be an independent company as opposed to a spinoff of a larger corporation.
Each company was evaluated in three primary areas: company reputation, employee satisfaction and growth. To assess employer reputation, Statista culled articles, blogs and social media posts about each employer and identified such phrases such as “corporate culture,” “employee engagement” and “company strategy.” Text analysis was used to categorize each finding as positive, negative or neutral. To evaluate employee satisfaction, Statista likewise researched online reviews, blog comments and company policies on such issues as compensation packages, healthcare and leave benefits, remote work and diversity-promoting initiatives. Growth was assessed by examining the organizations’ head counts, job openings and website traffic growth rate over a two-year period.
Ultimately, millions of such data points were used to determine each company’s score, and the 500 startups with the highest scores made our final ranking of America’s Best Startup Employers 2025.

And you might have seen or read news about artificial intelligence could displace or replace human engineers in certain jobs!
But don’t worry. Engineering will still offer many exciting and well–paid career opportunities. In fact, across several fields, engineers are expected to be in high demand across the next ten years…and beyond.
In the UK alone, engineering occupations are expected to grow by 2.8% by 2030. This is expected to add 173,000 new jobs to the UK economy.
A recent report from Lightcast also found that the range of skills required by engineering employers is becoming broader and more diverse. Here are just two ways in which the engineering labour market is changing.
Growing demand for specialist skills
Demand for specialised engineering skills is growing, with the number of adverts for specialised engineering jobs growing significantly compared to 2016/17.
Furthermore, emerging engineering fields such as robotics and biomedical engineering have seen the most growth.
The changing nature of software skills
45% of job postings require software skills, but the composition of these software skills has also changed, driven by the rise of new software and the development of technologies such as cloud computing.
Automation and robotic skills.
Programming language skills.
Computer-aided design skills (CAD).
The types of jobs being advertised in the engineering sector are now becoming more focused on sustainability and the green economy. For example, the Lightcast report also found that there is now a higher proportion of job adverts with titles such as “environmental engineers”, “renewable engineers” or “environmental consultant”.
Demand for jobs such as specialist solar installers has also increased dramatically.
This is great news if you’re thinking of becoming an engineer. But the changing nature of skills and labour market demand means it’s never been more important to understand the skills and qualifications needed to be a successful engineer.
So in this post, we’ll discuss the different kinds of engineering jobs that are available to you as the labour market changes. We’ll look at how some of the current engineering fields are likely to change and we’ll explore some of the new and exciting types of engineering jobs that might be on offer to you.
Civil engineering
The field of civil engineering will have to adapt if is to meet the net zero targets and align with the green industrial strategies of countries all around the world.
Of course, this is especially true of the UK, where both the current UK government and the opposition parties in Parliament have expressed their commitment to achieving net zero by 2050.
Indeed, the civil engineering sector will need to be mindful of its own carbon footprint. A recent study from the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) reported that 70% of carbon dioxide emissions were linked, either directly or indirectly, to the creation and everyday use of new infrastructure.
This same ICE report contains a perfect summary of why civil engineering will be such a vital skill in the fight to tackle climate change.
“Problem-solving skills, logical thinking, technical knowledge and understanding of materials make engineers ideally suited to respond to emergency situations. Climate change is an emergency, and the same thinking that engineers bring to natural disasters or war situations needs to be applied to solving this crisis.”
Civil engineering is therefore going to be at the forefront of ensuring that carbon emissions are no longer an automatic by-product of building new infrastructure.
Civil engineers will have to find innovative new ways to deliver projects while reducing the carbon footprint of those projects. It’s a big challenge, but it also means that civil engineers will continue to in high demand in the coming years and decades.
For example, if you choose to go into civil engineering in the coming years, you could be asked to solve problems such as
Designing infrastructure that enables people to make more low-carbon lifestyle choices e.g. cycle lane infrastructure that incorporates tree planting.
Building infrastructure systems that are more resilient in the face of more severe temperatures.
Planning climate adaptation into the early design of projects.
Let’s take a closer look at some of the key skills and responsibilities that civil engineers will be required to have in the coming years.
Designing sustainable infrastructure
This refers to any and all infrastructure that is built so as to minimise negative environmental impacts. Some examples of this could include:
Conducting environmental impact assessments to uderstand how infrastructure projects could impact on surrounding ecosystems and local communities.
Using innovative design principles to design infrastructure that reduces harmful carbon emissions.
Finding ways to use recycled and/or locally sourced materials during construction projects
Designing alternative, pedestrian infrastructure to reduce traffic congestion and encourage people to use cleaner modes of transport (e.g. cycling, walking).
Helping to build green energy infrastructure
As well as finding new ways to design the infrastructure we already use in our daily lives (e.g. roads, railways, bridges, new buildings), civil engineers will likely play an exciting role in designing new green energy infrastructure.
Some examples could include
Ensuring that solar farms and wind turbines have stable foundations to support their structures.
Planning and co-ordinating the integration of renewable energy resources into the existing power grid.
Assessing the environmental impact of renewable energy infrastructure.
Improving transport infrastructure to support renewable energy construction.
Chemical engineering
Like civil engineering, chemical engineering will offer the workforce of the future plenty of opportunities to reskill and adapt to the challenges of a changing world.
It may not seem obvious, but there are many ways in which chemical engineering can play a role in helping to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change.
Water treatment and supply
Chemical engineers have an essential role to play in designing systems to recycle and reuse water. In the future, you can expect to find yourself working on managing the environmental risks associated with water treatment and discharge.
For example, chemical engineers will likely design advanced intelligent control and cybersecurity systems to manage water quality and supply.
Sustainable farming and food production
Major improvements in agricultural production in the last century means that, until now, global food production has kept pace with population growth.
Soon however, this may no longer be the case. And chemical engineers will be integral in the quest to find means of food production that meet population demand without increasing our energy, water or land use. This is going to be a difficult balance to strike!
For example, chemical engineers will also be needed in finding ways for farmers to fight pests or diseases that could attack or spoil their crops. New, climate friendly technologies and processes will be required, such as sustainable, alternative fertilisers.
Chemical engineers will also be pivotal as food production is forced to adapt to a changing climate. You could find yourself working on projects to enhance local food production, making desert areas or urban rooftops viable for growing crops!
Your expertise in water purification and desalination projects will be crucial for providing the water needed for agriculture in arid regions, ensuring a steady food supply for communities that could be risk of shortages.
Ensuring energy security
While new sources of renewable energy will be important in the future. But an over-reliance on one source of renewable energy could leave the UK (and other countries) open to price shocks or supply shortages.
Here’s a few ways a chemical engineer might work to ensure energy security.
Developing materials and processes to enhance the efficiency and durability of solar panels.
Playing a vital role in improving wind turbines’ material properties, increasing their efficiency, and reducing maintenance and manufacturing costs.
Contributing to the design and optimisation of hydroelectric power plants, improving their efficiency and minimising environmental impacts.
Assisting in optimising fluid flow and heat transfer systems used in geothermal power generation.
Mechanical engineering
Because mechanical engineering involves the study of physical machines it is, by definition, going to be profoundly affected by the arrival of AI.
And like the other two engineering fields we’ve already covered in this section, mechanical engineering is also going to undergo massive changes as a result of robotics, AI and climate change.
Mechanical engineering is arguably the broadest of the four main engineering fields. And just a brief glance of some of the sub-fields within it points to the ways it will evolve to meet the challenges of the future. For example:
The computer-aided design tools that mechanical engineers use will become more advanced and complex.
Heating and cooling (HVAC) systems will become more integral as we seek to mitigate our houses and buildings against the extreme temperatures caused by climate change
Industrial equipment used in manufacturing will likely become more intelligent, and potentially automate more manual tasks.
Mechanical engineering in renewable energy
Mechanical systems will be crucial to the UK building a long-term, sustainable energy infrastructure.
Much like chemical engineers and civil engineers, the mechanical engineers of the future will be crucial to the design and building of renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar panel systems, wind turbines and geo-thermal heating systems.
For example, a mechanical engineer might play a role in making wind turbines more efficient and quiet. Specifically, the mechanical engineer would work on the design of a wind turbine’s physical and structural opponent. They would also optimise the blade design of the wind turbines, making them more aerodynamic.
This is a much needed innovation at a time when wind energy will be required to power our homes, streets and offices.
Likewise, mechanical engineers work on the design and structural integrity of solar panel frames and mounting systems. They ensure that the components of solar panels can withstand environmental stresses such as wind, rain, and temperature fluctuations.
Sustainable building design
As we discussed in the previous sections, engineers will need to find new ways to manage construction projects that significantly lessen their carbon footprint.
Mechanical engineers will play a crucial role in making sure that the buildings of the future have a more sustainable design. An example is HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems to improve air quality, systems to better conserve water, or lighting designs that are more energy efficient.
The need for mechanical engineers in robotics
Robotics is likely to be one speciality where mechanical engineers will be in high demand. At the moment, mechanical engineers are involved in the design of robots that will be used to assemble robots in manufacturing.
Likewise, robotics will become more integral in the healthcare field. For example, surgical robots might be perform operations on patients with more precision than human surgeons, but they must still be designed in a way that guarantees patient safety.
If you’re interested in the field of robotics, then mechanical engineering a field that’s definitely worth considering.
Making transport more environmentally friendly
Mechanical engineers might contribute to the design of environmnentally friendly public transport systems – think of the hybrid, electric or hydrogen powered buses you might have already seen on the streets of some UK cities!
This means that the mechanical engineers of tomorrow will be integral to the design of new forms of public transport that will cut carbon emissions and reduce traffic congestion.
It’s not just public transport. Mechanical engineers will continue to be crucial in the design and building of electric and hybrid cars. Replacing internal combustion-based engines with battery powered systems will require mechanical and automotive engineers who know how to:
Design the physical structure of EVs, including the chassis and body, focusing on aerodynamics, safety, and efficiency.
Work on the thermal management systems to keep the battery and electronics at optimal operating temperatures
Electrical engineering
Many of the applications for electricall engineering in the economies and societies of the future will be similar to that of mechanical engineering.
Electrical engineering and renewable energy
Remember those renewable energy solutions we talked about in the previous section?
While mechanical engineers would work on the design and development of the structural components, electrical engineers would work on the electrical components and systems that power wind turbines.
For example, because of the unpredictability of wind energy, the generators that transform wind power into electricity can sometimes be quite inconsistent. Electrical engineers manage the consistency of a generator’s power output and try to ensure it aligns with the requirement of the electrical grid.
An electrical engineer also develops and implements the control systems that monitor and manage the operation of the wind turbine, ensuring optimal performance and diagnosing issues
Likewise, electrical engineers would complement the work of mechanical engineers on the construction of solar panels. Electrical engineers are involved in the design and optimisation of the photovoltaic cells themselves, focusing on increasing the conversion efficiency of sunlight to electricity.
Electric cars and vehicles
In the previous section, we discussed how mechanical engineers will be in high demand when it comes to designing environmentally friendly transport and electric vehicles.
While mechanical engineers will tend to focus more on structural components like the chassis systems, power transmission, structural frames, brake systems and aerodynamics, electrical engineers will focus more on the electrical software and systems that power and control the vehicle.
Specifically, electrical engineers will work on the EV battery technology, power electronics, embedded software, instrumentation and controls in the car.
Sustainable energy design
Electrical engineers design the control systems and automation features that make HVAC systems smart and energy-efficient. This includes developing sensors and controls for monitoring indoor air quality, temperature, humidity, and occupancy, and automating system responses to optimise energy use.
In sustainable buildings, electrical engineers work on integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, into the building’s energy supply. They ensure that the electricity generated is compatible with the building’s systems and the grid, and they

The Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA) provides a detailed weekly roundup of mergers and acquisitions news, highlighting the most significant global M&A deals. This essential update offers a snapshot of the latest movements and trends within the M&A market, showcasing the top transactions that stand out in the corporate world. Through this coverage, IMAA aims to furnish M&A professionals and enthusiasts alike with a comprehensive overview of the week’s M&A activities, helping them stay informed about the evolving landscape of global mergers and acquisitions.
During the week of August 4 to August 10, the global mergers and acquisitions market saw considerable activity with 691 deals announced, totaling approximately USD 68.52 billion. Notably, 25 transactions valued at over USD 500 million each represented about 82% of the total deal value, amounting to USD 56.08 billion.
The largest deal of the week was Amphenol’s USD 10.5 billion all-cash acquisition of CommScope’s Connectivity and Cable Solutions business. This acquisition enhances Amphenol’s position in the expanding IT datacom market by incorporating CCS’s broad portfolio of fiber optic interconnect products, which are critical for applications such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data centers.
Blackstone also made two significant acquisitions: Enverus for USD 6.5 billion and Japan’s TechnoPro Holdings for USD 3.5 billion. Enverus specializes in energy analytics and artificial intelligence-driven market intelligence, complementing Blackstone’s strategy to expand its presence in energy-related industries amid the global energy transition. TechnoPro provides specialized staffing and engineering services, supporting Blackstone’s deeper entry into Japan’s infrastructure and technology markets. These deals reflect a revival of private equity interest in sectors benefiting from technological innovation and favorable market reforms in both the United States and Japan.
Compared to the previous week, deal volume remained consistent with the previous week at 691, but total deal value fell by 63% from USD 184.82 billion to USD 68.52 billion. This decrease likely reflects a lower number of large-scale transactions during the period. Nevertheless, the steady deal volume suggests sustained investor confidence in the market.

Deal No. 1:
Amphenol Corporation to Acquire Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS) business of CommScope for USD 10.50 Billion
Amphenol Corporation, a global provider of interconnect solutions, has agreed to acquire CommScope’s Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS) business for USD 10.5 billion in cash, enhancing its broadband portfolio and strengthening its network infrastructure offerings.
The CCS division, CommScope’s largest business segment, delivers fiber-optic and copper cabling, connectors, and infrastructure systems serving data centers, broadband networks, and commercial buildings. It consists of three units—Data Center Connectivity Solutions, Broadband Communications, and Building Connectivity Solutions. In 2024, CCS generated approximately USD 2.8 billion in net sales, fueled by strong demand for data center infrastructure to support generative AI (GenAI) deployments, and is projected to achieve around USD 3.6 billion in sales with a 26% EBITDA margin in 2025.
The acquisition will broaden Amphenol’s capabilities in the IT datacom sector, adding advanced fiber-optic interconnect solutions for AI and other data center applications, while further diversifying its communications and industrial market offerings. For CommScope, the divestiture marks a major step in its strategy to streamline operations and strengthen its balance sheet.
The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2026, will be financed through a combination of available cash and new debt. Amphenol has secured committed funding from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BNP Paribas, and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as its financial advisor.

Blackstone has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Enverus, a major provider of energy data and analytics, in a deal valued at up to USD 6.5 billion, making it one of Blackstone’s largest transactions of the year.

The company serves more than 8,000 customers in 50 countries, including over 95% of U.S. energy producers and 40,000 suppliers, offering capabilities that support exploration, production optimization, market intelligence, and strategic decision-making.
The acquisition aligns with Blackstone’s investment focus on rising electricity demand and the global energy transition, following recent transactions involving Potomac Energy Center, Sediver, Westwood Professional Services, and Trystar.
The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year 2025, subject to customary approvals. Citi and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC advised Enverus and current owner Hellman & Friedman, while RBC Capital Markets LLC advised Blackstone.

Brookfield Corporation to Acquire Duke Energy Florida, LLC for USD 6.00 Billion
Duke Energy, a major U.S. utility provider, will sell a 19.7% stake in its subsidiary, Duke Energy Florida, to Brookfield in an all-cash transaction valued at USD 6 billion.
Duke Energy Florida supplies electricity to roughly 2 million customers across central and western Florida and operates as a vertically integrated utility that is central to the state’s power network. The business is an essential part of Florida’s energy system, with ongoing investments in grid modernization, renewable generation, and system reliability to meet growing demand.
The transaction, to be completed through Brookfield’s Super Core Infrastructure strategy, is expected to strengthen Duke Energy’s balance sheet, release capital for expansion in its electric and gas utility segments, and advance its clean energy objectives. Duke Energy will retain an 80.3 percent stake, ensuring operational control and continuity with its existing workforce.
Proceeds will help accelerate Duke Energy Florida’s five-year capital plan, increasing total investment in the state to more than USD 16 billion through 2029. The program will focus on infrastructure upgrades and clean energy projects. For Brookfield, the investment offers long-term exposure to a regulated utility with strong growth potential in a favorable economic and demographic environment.
The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is advising Duke Energy, while RBC Capital Markets LLC is advising Brookfield.

Engineering hiring trends, in-demand jobs & top salaries: 2025
Addison Group
Engineers in just about any role are not worried about finding a job right now. The ratio of job openings to engineers today is about 3-1 and that’s down from last year when there were seven listings for every candidate.
1
While the market has cooled slightly, companies are still on the hunt for top talent in a variety of positions from project management to mechanical and electrical engineers.
As energy, oil, and gas industries post record profits, they also face an engineering talent drought even as it works to tackle climate change and the transition from fossil fuel to alternative energy sources. Manufacturers will need to fill over 30,000 new engineering jobs by 2029 across every sector from healthcare and automotive to aerospace and defense.
2
Construction is also hot – especially high-level engineering management roles.
Compensation continues to be the primary factor for engineering talent, necessitating competitive offers from employers. While candidates have been showing increased openness to new opportunities, there’s still a noticeable hesitancy, likely due to the tighter market. Employers are also being extra cautious before they make an offer. Despite this, time-to-hire rates are continuing to improve.
“Our hiring cycle over the past year have improved about 25% – we’re at about 30-45 days from the time we receive a job to the day a candidate accepts an offer.”
Ed Meindl, Regional Vice President, Addison Group
Double down on culture
Hesitation on the part of both employers and candidates may be due to the engineering hiring frenzy over the past couple of years which led to hires that haven’t always been successful. Some companies who hired out-of-state candidates for fully remote jobs have reported negative results from those decisions. Today, companies and employees are taking much more time to evaluate the right fit. Longer interview processes have become the norm – moving from 2 interviews to as many as 8 interviews with multiple team members. In some cases, this has resulted in companies losing a strong candidate to another company that moves faster.
Welcome to the new normal
As companies look to rebuild culture, more are also steering away from totally remote positions to a combination of on-site jobs or some form of hybrid workplace where employees work in-office one to two days a week to meet and socialize with co-workers.
Addison Group
is seeing 70% of companies bringing work completely back into the office and 30% settling into a hybrid model. As companies bring more people back to the office, they are also focusing more on promoting benefits packages in addition to competitive salaries to lure candidates.

Cyberdesk is the first self learning computer use agent for developers to automate desktop workflows. 

For example, one of our customers is building an AI agent for hospital patient intake, and they’re using us to automate an entire team of people manually clicking and typing into a desktop app to book appointments. 

We launched mid July and we’ve closed 212k ARR. Our agent is already operating in production environments, creating appointments in electronic health record apps and processing files in legacy ERPs.

We’ve built the first computer use agent that memorizes tasks and repeats them quickly while still adapting to unexpected changes on the screen. A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.

Mahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. 

Alan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.

Computer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.

We're 2 repeat YC founders. We founded Plato (W16, sold to Coda) and Wolfia (S22). Quang lead Product/GTM for Coda Solutions and Fabien is ex-SWE at Meta and lead Engineering at Wealthfront before.

We’re building Vybe: ""Lovable for internal apps"". We come with pre-built building blocks: Integrations (Gmail, Gcal, Github, Jira, etc.), SSO and AI tools (Websearch, Summarization etc.) so anyone in a company can build and launch internal AI-powered apps.

Vibe coding is dramatically lowering the barrier for non-technical users to create full web apps. Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Google, Canva, Figma all launched their vibe-coding platforms. People love them. They're great for prototyping, but it's difficult to roll out inside a company for internal use cases for those reasons: 

1. Data: If you want to connect your existing data (e.g. Salesforce, Gmail, Jira), you'd need to rebuild the API auth, pagination, etc. 

2. SSO: If you build 20 apps, you'll have 20 different logins

3. Security: AI-built apps have massive risk of exposing data, especially if built by non developers

So companies are stuck in the old world: clunky spreadsheets, rigid SaaS solutions or complex no-code tools.

Almost every company that has to integrate with the legacy financial institutions, faces several challenges when it comes to the product cycle. Not only are the APIs and documentations less available, but they are also old school and ridden with errors and loopholes. 

On top of that, the lack of a single point of contact from the underlying institutions, makes the already long integration cycle of 5 months feel like a temple run between different departments. And since those services break and update over time, you can imagine the nightmare in terms of coordination between the tech teams. 

We are a full-stack platform where you can come, select your desired modules, play in the sandbox, and launch your product with the APIs and SDKs within a couple of weeks! Not only that, but we also take care of all upcoming fixes, iterations, and updates without breaking any flow.

It's that easy, as it should be. Welcome to the future.

Echoes gives engineering leaders visibility into the alignment of engineering efforts against the business goals and whether their deliveries are having actual business impacts.

By doing so we enable engineering leaders to make informed decisions on hiring and priorities, to communicate effectively on their team's activity to their business partners/bosses/investors, and to build engagement by putting their team's work into context.

We achieve this by offering a seamless way for engineers to connect their day-to-day contributions to their intent, creating the missing link between tech outputs and business outcomes.

Voker is a no-code platform that empowers product teams to build AI features in minutes without involving engineers. Companies like Lull.com and Dutch.com are using our platform to improve their consumer experience and retention.

Alex and Tyler met at a high-growth E-Commerce startup where Tyler was running Technology & Data. Together, they built AI products that bootstrapped the company profitably to $100MM in Revenue.

Alex experienced firsthand the broken developer experience in AI while building enterprise infrastructure at Yardi. Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple AI features. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct. Within a week we had two paying customers even before launching our first prototype.

Voker is built for product specialists who know they can delight their users with AI but can't spend engineering bandwidth on building those features. By making AI accessible and practical, Voker helps these businesses profit from this new wave of innovation.

Our Mission: 
We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.


The Problem: 
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).


Our Approach: 
In our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.

2024 was a whirlwind of exciting achievements and complex challenges, highlighting the global impact of the civil engineering profession:
Cities of the Future
: Engineering is where creativity meets hardcore problem-solving. Last spring, we unveiled our new IMAX film,
Cities of the Future
, which depicts how civil engineers turn visionary ideas into reality. Museum science center and theater audiences have been thrilled by the 3D giant-screen experience of engineering and infrastructure. The film is complemented by
educational materials
and the virtual reality
Future World Vision
experience. Our
Send a Kid to the Future
fundraising campaign breaks down barriers by allowing more children and students to experience this incredible movie.
Bridging the Gap
: We released “
Bridging the Gap
,” a detailed report on the effects of meaningful infrastructure investment on American households and businesses, especially considering recent legislation. This study, conducted every four years, prepares us for the
2025 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure
, released this month. In November, we hosted an infrastructure finance summit, collaborating with the financial industry to educate them on how municipal bonds and updated standards and codes can strengthen infrastructure and improve investments.
Strategic plan advancements
: Guided by our
strategic plan
, we’re making giant leaps forward with our new digital strategy, Standards Office, AMPLIFY standards website, and a new Grants and Contracts Office. These initiatives enable us to partner with federal agencies to advance resilient infrastructure through ASCE standards and training programs. At the same time, ASCE offered a wide variety of technical conferences, continuing education programs, publications, and other professional and technical training programs that engaged tens of thousands of students and practicing engineers across the globe.
Education and workforce initiatives
: We promoted ASCE education and workforce initiatives with various task committees, coalitions, and United Engineering Foundation-funded projects, including the Engineering and Public Works Roadshow and the Engineering Workforce Consortium. These collaborative efforts, in partnership with the American Council of Engineering Companies and the American Public Works Association, aim to attract, retain, and inspire the next generation of civil engineers.
Community building
: At our core, we are a community of people working together to elevate the civil engineering profession. We launched two communities of practice pilots: one focused on
diversity, equity, and inclusion
and another on sustainability and resilience to empower community-building opportunities.
While celebrating ASCE’s accomplishments, we recognize that your dedication to the Society and the profession is pivotal to these triumphs. Together, as trusted infrastructure leaders, we are forging a better future.
We look forward to a future when the ingenuity and dedication of civil engineers will be the cornerstone of a thriving and adaptable world.
Sincerely,
Marsia Geldert-Murphey, P.E., F.ASCE, and Thomas W. Smith III, ENV SP, CAE, F.ASCE

The compensation figures below reflect median total yearly compensation amounts, including base salaries, stock grants, and bonuses.
It's a difficult task to accurately compare leveling across companies. We aim to make that comparison as easy as possible, using our
standard leveling framework
. Currently, standard leveling is
only available for Software Engineer positions within companies that have leveling structures submitted to our database
. Median compensation across all levels is supported for all job roles.
You may see that some level/location combinations yield little to no valid data, but with your help, we can change that. If you would like to help support our mission to
help people make better career decisions
, we encourage you to contribute via
Add Compensation
,
Add Level Mapping
, and
Add Benefits
. Feel free to share data and levels.fyi with your friends, family, co-workers, classmates, and colleagues and encourage them to do the same! The more data points we have, the more power we have to change the culture around salary transparency, helping job seekers all across the world.
Want to give yourself the best shot at getting a job with one of these companies? We can help! Many companies rely on automated parsing software for resumes. Your resume could be the first impression they have of you, and it can make or break your chances of getting through to the next step of the hiring process. We provide a
1-on-1 Resume Review
service where our team of experienced recruiters can help increase your chances of breaking through that first step.
Do you have an offer from one of these companies, but the numbers don't line up? We can help with that, too! We provide
1-on-1 Salary Negotiation Support
coaching to help you learn the ins and outs of negotiating to ensure you're getting the right offer! Even if it's not an offer from a company on this list, you can browse our
compensation database
to determine if you are being compensated fairly.

Public and private sector practitioners highlight best practices to meet generational infrastructure moment.
(
Download
)
Passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in late 2021 was a watershed moment for investment in our nation’s infrastructure. The law begins to reverse decades of underinvestment in our nation’s roads, bridges, and water systems, while expanding energy investments, connecting all Americans with high-speed internet, and more.
Investments and policy improvements enabled by the law are welcomed by communities across the country eager to strengthen their economies and improve the quality of life for their residents. However, these increased investment levels amid accelerating retirement trends and poor attrition rates in the infrastructure space are compounding existing gaps in the engineering and infrastructure workforce and threaten the overall impact of this generational opportunity.
To address these challenges, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the National Governors Association (NGA) Center for Best Practices convened a group of practitioners to identify actionable approaches that private industry and public sector infrastructure groups can utilize to address workforce shortages.
During the one-day roundtable in May 2023, ASCE and NGA solicited workforce development input from America’s Governors’ offices and appointees, the federal government, infrastructure owners, operators from the public and private sectors, engineering contractors, and academics training tomorrow’s workforce. In addition to discussing employer best practices, the roundtable also included discussion of short- and longer-term solutions that employers and states can implement via programs and policy to grow the pipeline of engineers and infrastructure workers.
Specifically, roundtable participants discussed:
Short-term recruitment and retention strategies for the engineering and infrastructure professions, including:
Identifying current workforce pain points and goals
Evaluating compensation, flexibility, and advancement opportunities
Incorporating caregiving needs into workplace programming and culture
Supporting employees on the sidelines with flexible career re-entry tools
Reducing time-to-hire and other recruitment barriers
Reducing barriers to procurement success for small firms and disadvantaged business enterprises
Reducing barriers to entry as the pipeline expands
Offering place-based opportunities in communities benefiting from investment
Building strategic partnerships with schools, skills, and community organizations
Praising and promoting the technical achievements of infrastructure
Long-term education and industry advancement strategies, including:
Increasing the affordability of education
Creating multiple entry points to the engineering and infrastructure professions
Developing college programming for engineering student retention and support
Encouraging high school students to enter infrastructure professions
Developing and supporting STEM curriculum in K-12 education
The following brief summarizes examples and key takeaways from the discussion on the above topics.
Short-Term Recruitment & Retention Strategies for the Engineering and Infrastructure Professions
Identify Current Workforce Pain Points and Goals
Expectations and needs at both public agencies and private firms have shifted. To better identify those shifts, employers should consider assessing existing opportunities and gaps with staff surveys, listening sessions, and plans with actionable steps. Many organizations share challenges like work-life balance, retention, advancement, and job satisfaction. But there are often very specific engineering needs in different contexts and individual businesses.
In 2023, when Kishia L. Powell became General Manager and CEO of WSSC Water, one of the largest water and wastewater utilities in the nation, she approached the transition by establishing a Transition Team – made up of a broad cross-section of employees from nearly every department within the organization. The mission of the team was to assess pain points, amplify what worked well and develop specific and measurable recommendations to chart a new path forward. The group provided candid feedback that addressed both perennial and anticipated challenges within the organization. Through the listening sessions and various other feedback loops, 178 actions were identified and eventually incorporated into the
WSSC Water 2023 Transition Report
—50  of which related to workforce needs and priorities. The plan included concerns heard from plant engineers, accountants, pipeline technicians, and cybersecurity experts, among others.
Evaluate Compensation, Flexibility, and Advancement Opportunities
Workforce recruitment and retention within this sector could benefit from providing employees with competitive pay, benefits, mentorship, and advancement opportunities. Infrastructure contractors and the private sector generally have greater flexibility on these issues, but they too face financial constraints. Raising staff pay must be balanced with competitive bids for projects and fiduciary obligations to investors.
One strategy the public sector might consider is requesting special authority to increase pay scales in some specialties and geographic areas. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has successfully bolstered retention and recruitment by securing special salary authority. The Corps was also granted “direct-hire authority” to make job offers more quickly, especially for urgent needs (for example, electrical engineers working on hydropower plants in remote locations).
Incorporate Caregiving Needs into Workplace Programming and Culture
Women earned 28% of undergraduate civil engineering degrees
in 2021
, but they accounted for only 17% of civil engineering employment
in that same year
. Across all architecture and engineering fields, women have grown slowly as a portion of the workforce: to 16% of the industry in 2022, from 14% in 2012, and 12% in 2002. That’s compared to chemical science, which grew from 30% to 46% female in those 20 years.
Infrastructure fields are losing women employees at a rapid pace, especially around the age
they have children
. Also, female engineers
report
that “leaving engineering and trying to come back is not an easy feat. That is why many women who take a break to care for their children, never return.” In 2021, the Society of Women Engineers produced a literature review of its own annual education report. From those 20 annual reports,
the Society concluded
that “the field is perceived as hostile to women, and if women’s experiences in the field bear that out, they are unlikely to select it from the available options or to stay if they begin an engineering career.”
Infrastructure careers frequently require long hours, but workplace investments and programming can attract and retain workers who have caregiving responsibilities. An updated set of best practices, sophisticated support structures, and culture improvements can be valuable tools for the industry to succeed at that challenge. Adding remote work and flexible scheduling
has been proven
to attract high-quality talent.
Additionally, public and private entities could look to enhance training, development, and mentorship opportunities for all employees. Infrastructure employers can maximize the well-being and performance of their staff
with training, flexibility, and mentorship
. There is fear among some employers that limited budgets spent investing in existing workforce will be lost when staff leave; however, failing to provide professional development, upskilling, and other opportunities can result in overworked, under-supported workers who will be expensive to replace when they depart. Workers are happier and more likely to stay in their position and this industry when they are supported with training, provided sample roadmaps for tough choices in time management, and shown grace when balancing career with caregiving responsibility.
Support Employees on the Sidelines with Flexible Career Re-Entry Tools
Engineering and other infrastructure careers require continuing education to improve job performance and upskill in an evolving industry. Acquiring Professional Development Hour (PDH) credits and mid-career certifications shows continued proficiency and demonstrates new learning necessary for innovation. However,
infrastructure workers report
that continuing education requirements are frequently a financial and logistical barrier to re-entry into the field. Employers in the infrastructure space can encourage talent to rejoin the workforce by providing tailored pathways for recertification or re-licensure, as well as support staff looking to temporarily downshift by developing a roadmap for maintaining licensure in a way that matches an employee’s flexibility needs.
Reduce Time-to-Hire and Other Recruitment Barriers
Public sector infrastructure employers can improve their capacity to deploy infrastructure investments by expediting the hiring process, including the onboarding of each new hire. Many workers lack the time or flexibility to endure months of interviews, waiting for reviews and approvals, and the lingering uncertainty that arises between a verbal job offer and an official one.
Infrastructure employers may consider improving their workforce development quickly
by reducing
the internal and inter-departmental procedural hurdles of recruitment, such as civil service exam requirements. For example, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has a time-to-hire of about 60 days, ahead of many state agencies, and cultivates a recruitment culture characterized by urgency and efficiency. Once the agency decides to open a position, hiring managers are trained to prioritize interviews and recruiting activities over other job tasks. WSDOT makes recruitment timelines clear to job candidates and will hold back filling a position until the hiring team has bandwidth to focus on interviews.
Reduce Barriers to Procurement Success for Small Firms and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises
Leaders of small engineering and infrastructure firms, including those from disadvantaged business enterprises (DBE),
face significant challenges
leveraging existing programs to support their firms. Extensive paperwork and disparities for women and minority-owned employers intensify the burden of seeking certifications from different states, intrastate agencies, various municipalities, and even different contracts within the same funder entity.
Infrastructure funders can improve their support for these employers by taking specific measures. Reducing compliance work, granting reciprocity to procurement rules where state law and policy allow for these preferred workplaces, and expanding awareness of these programs among start-up and non-traditional firms can tackle bureaucratic hurdle and ease the burden of multiple certifications.
In certain cases, infrastructure decision-makers can nurture the success of DBE firms by advocating for policymakers’ support for those institutions with higher DBE requirements in public contracting. When jurisdictions actively pursue DBE goals and implement related procurement rules, they provide vital financial support, enabling these businesses to maintain high-quality work, sustain their operations, secure additional contracts, and invest in worker training. This approach empowers DBE firms but also fosters growth and competitiveness within the industry.
Reduce Barriers to Entry as the Pipeline Expands
Infrastructure employers will be most effective in addressing workforce challenges by lowering barriers to entry as they expand the pipeline of workers into engineering and technical trades. To reduce barriers, leaders can reconsider the minimum requirements of existing and new positions in their organizations. Job descriptions can be re-tooled to focus on capabilities rather than requirements that include a set number of years in specific previous roles and education programs of degrees received. Infrastructure employers could also benefit from reevaluation of which skills are truly necessary from day one – or trained up over time. Governors from New Jersey, Utah, and several other states
have supported this approach
.
Also, there are benefits from holistic review of workflows and considering re-assignment of regular work tasks to specialized, lower-cost positions with software tools and construction methods that can be approachable for candidates beginning their careers, changing careers, or re-entering the workforce.
Employers may find ready and willing workers who are “skill-adjacent” to the normally recruited populations. Engineering and infrastructure jobs require skills, many or most of which are also required by other fields. Examples of common adjacent skills include digital design modeling, quantitative data manipulation, and project management. Employers should consider what related industries also require these skills and which pools of talent could retool their skills from analogous applications into infrastructure competencies.
Offer Place-Based Opportunities in Communities Benefiting from Investment
The 2021 IIJA and other recent federal investments direct significant sums of money to disadvantaged communities, areas overlooked by previous infrastructure funding, and restorative projects within neighborhoods. Infrastructure employers can utilize dollars to hire locally for all different aspects of projects. The engineers who design, technicians who build, and managers who facilitate the construction or rehabilitation of a bridge are positioned to succeed on projects in their communities.
“
You have to see it to be it
”: Workers won’t pursue roles where they do not see people like themselves or feel unsafe. Diversity not only in leadership positions, but all types of roles within the company, creates a self-sustaining cycle of recruitment success. There is benefit from sharing the many paths to the job they have now: Lift up the leaders who transitioned from community colleges to four-year universities; celebrate the individuals thriving after mid-career industry changes, and later-in-life pursuits of classroom and job site training. Share the stories of senior leaders who began as liberal arts majors and those who were told “math and science isn’t for you.”
Employers in both the public and private sectors would benefit from demonstrations of more inclusivity to include racial diversity, women, and youth at in-person events and in their marketing campaigns. Infrastructure employers may find that job fairs, job shadowing, apprenticeships, and micro-internships are better subscribed programs when candidates meet staff who were subjected to similar challenges of racial discrimination, gender bias, economic disadvantage, or involvement with the criminal justice system.
Build Strategic Partnerships with Schools, Skills, and Community Organizations
Workforce challenges are complex and differ depending on industry, location, skill type, and many other factors. However, one common challenge faced by employers across the field is the recruitment and retention of workers from underrepresented backgrounds. “Where are the workers and how do we keep them?” is not a question with a simple answer.
Strategic partnerships connect stakeholders with different assets and capabilities. Employers will find more success recruiting from diverse student bodies when outreach is more proactive – for example, an official co-branded effort between campus leadership and c-suite. Importantly, student applicants may perform better if their professors and teachers prepare them with realistic job skills, knowledge, and expectations. Co-branded worksite visits, hard hat experiences, and curriculum developed with employer consultation modernize a school’s academic offerings. Finally, infrastructure employers may find greater success with these academic partnerships when financial support is tied to this learning. Financial aid may zero out the cost of a credit hour, but the opportunity cost of a job down the street remains.
For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has successfully partnered with the University of Puerto Rico to recruit from its engineering school. The Corps also focuses on outreach and partnership with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). These and other strategic initiatives
help USACE
reach 32% female employees and 23% staffing from racially diverse backgrounds. An effective aspect of their recruiting process is creating a culture of belonging and ensuring that diverse participants are involved at all roles and levels of leadership in the agency or company.
Despite their comprehensive academic experience, many engineering students, including their professors, may lack familiarity with the unique applications of classroom fundamentals. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company reaches out to schools with coastal and inland waterway programs, with invitations to school leadership and teachers to provide real-world, hands-on experience. The company has found that exciting professors and school leadership about their industry has the outsized impact of exciting entire student cohorts. In other words, getting educators interested in infrastructure is a significant step to sparking the fascination of their students.
Partnerships can provide low-stakes, alternative pathways to someone who would be the first person in their family to go to college, the only young person on their block to consider a STEM field, or who is wary that longer, higher-stakes commitments might come with more risks than benefits. Southern Illinois University at Carbondale has a campus in East St. Louis where Illinois DOT runs a cooperative Civil Engineering Technician Program. Students are required only to have a high school diploma or GED and be from a disadvantaged community. The 10-week training is free, students receive a $300 per week stipend, and are guaranteed a job at Illinois Department of Transportation with an 18-month commitment.
Infrastructure employers can succeed with more diverse recruitment by building strategic partnerships with specific schools, trade unions, guilds, skill-based organizations, and community groups with trust in communities of varying geographies, racial, gender or other identities. Infrastructure employers have found success with other work exposure and apprenticeship programs facilitated through state and local chambers of commerce, labor unions, community colleges, technical high schools, and criminal justice trial-diversion programs.
Praise and Promote the Technical Achievements of Infrastructure
Too often in engineering and public infrastructure, workers are scorned for public failures and only rarely praised publicly for their successes. Innovation in drinking water treatment methods is fodder for niche industry publications, while boil water advisories and power outages are covered widely by mainstream media. Most people have heard of their state department of transportation, water utility, and other infrastructure owner, but it’s likely they don’t associate those places with job opportunities and public acclaim.
Infrastructure employers and owner-operators can use traditional and social media to attract attention to infrastructure and civil works fields. The use of social media platforms, outreach and hiring efforts can be extended to a larger demographic with revamped industry branding efforts to portray a more diverse workforce that reflects the current U.S. population. Marketing partnerships with high-viewership media are a highly effective strategy. WSDOT saw an increase in job applications after advertisements during NFL games and the Olympics.
Interactive digital experiences and hard hat open houses attract residents and other stakeholders who pay little mind to infrastructure systems when they work well. Leaders can share “Day in the Life” stories on social media like Instagram to make infrastructure jobs relatable and real to viewers.
Long-Term Education & Industry Advancement Strategies
Increase the Affordability of Education
The cost of education and training can be a prohibitive financial barrier and deterrent for many potential infrastructure workers. The burden impacts those pursuing engineering degrees at a four-year university, individuals balancing low wages with community college, or students paying up-front costs of technical training and certifications. Infrastructure employers can consider tuition repayment programs, while the public sector may consider loan forgiveness and payment matching, and similar subsidies.
Create Multiple Entry Points to the Engineering and Infrastructure Professions
Solving the workforce challenge requires more than increasing the number of engineering graduates. Infrastructure employers should build multiple career pathways with on-ramps that support highly skilled professionals, entry-level workers, and workers with non-traditional backgrounds. Military veterans often specialize while on active duty, but their training includes transferrable skills like project management and team leadership. Infrastructure employers are finding success translating military experience into public infrastructure service. Employers can find success in supporting military veterans transitioning back into the civilian workforce with outreach and rapid re-training opportunities.
Develop College Programming for Engineering Student Retention and Support
Significant numbers of college students studying engineering face difficulties early – often in their first year –
and especially
if they are from backgrounds underrepresented in the profession. These headwinds present challenges before students arrive on campus and stretch far beyond the classroom. For example, family support may be present for first-gen and continuing-gen students, but the latter may receive specific advice on academics while the former must look elsewhere for advice on difficult assignments. However, academic institutions and stakeholders in infrastructure can be more effective in retaining students by developing and investing in programming outside the classroom.
Mississippi State University offers a summer bridge program for rising high school seniors and incoming first-year students enrolling in their Bagley College of Engineering. The five-week program is free, and includes on-campus housing, access to class instructors, peer mentors, textbooks and materials, some meals, and more. Math remediation and entry-level science courses are also offered to make up for insufficient and under-resourced high school environments and better prepare students for more rigorous college coursework. These wraparound benefits, as well as the supportive introduction into intensive coursework, significantly increases retention rates for first-generation and low-income students, as well as students from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds.
Organizations may also find success removing the financial barriers of entry for students underrepresented in the infrastructure field. The National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) works with HBCUs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and organizations targeting similar populations to provide scholarships, resources, and opportunities for high-achieving, underrepresented minority college students pursuing careers in engineering. When those barriers can be removed, engineering students are better able to adjust to a new learning and living environment and persist through their first year increasing the probability of timely graduation rates.
Encourage High School Students to Enter Infrastructure Professions
According to
the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, 75% of the 15 million new and saved infrastructure jobs from recent federal investments only require a high school diploma or some short-term credentials or training.
A separate study
from the Brookings Institute found that infrastructure occupations pay 30% higher wages to lower-income workers. When considering entry-level employment, high school seniors would command higher wages and more advancement when entering professions like bus and truck mechanic, highway maintenance worker, or electrical power-line installer, compared to other jobs.
The Generation Z cohort seeks and stays with employers that display socially minded values and conduct work that benefits the public. The Millennial cohort displays similar mission-driven desires. Those two groups, everyone under age 42, are tomorrow’s senior project leaders and shepherds of organizations implementing recent and future infrastructure investment.
To help with recruitment, the civil engineering industry can better advertise the role employees can have in bettering their communities, and that engineering is a difficult but attainable profession.
ASCE organizes and supports
the establishment of civil engineering clubs, which let high school students meet, work with mentors, and explore the civil engineering field through activities, lessons, and field trips. Multimedia content and interactive experiences help students visualize the potential a career in civil engineering. For example, ASCE produced a feature-length film called “Dream Big,” which highlighted the most exciting people and engineering projects across the globe. “Cities of the Future,” which will debut in IMAX theatres fall 2023, explores how our world is adapting to population, climate, and technology trends. The film tours the captivating possibilities of a city in 2075, in hopes of inspiring today’s youngest minds to take up civil engineering and contribute to a better tomorrow.
Develop and Support STEM Curriculum in K-12 Education
STEM education has been a priority for many years in American politics and curriculum development. Infrastructure leaders would benefit from supplementing this attention and funding with classroom and off-site programming that shows infrastructure jobs as applications of many science and math topics discussed in STEM lessons.
To solve the engineering workforce challenges, America can double down on efforts to recruit and support more and better teachers. Infrastructure stakeholders will also find benefits from joining coalitions and partnerships to improve access to high-quality education on fundamental topics. The Mississippi School for Mathematics provides 200 students each year with an extremely high level of instruction in STEM fundamentals. The public school would enroll more students, but it depends on funding that is frequently threatened. Despite that uncertainty, the school leverages technology to reach beyond on-site enrollment with distance learning classes in basic science and engineering that reach rural and low-resource schools across the state.
No One-Size-Fits-All Solution to Workforce Challenges
There is not a singular workforce challenge in America’s engineering and infrastructure industry, but rather many challenges that can be met with varied, innovative solutions and creative leadership. Maximizing the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and other investment requires the breaking down of specialty silos, the re-thinking of jobs as collections of acquired skills, and the support of a workplace offering flexibility of work that values an individual’s life outside of the office or job site.
Looking to the future, our communities will be best served by emphasizing the role engineering and infrastructure play in community-wide problem-solving and making the world a better place to live. Employers should be ready to retool their training methods and work with academics to connect the wonders of STEM topics with the awesome power of their application.

How Has The Engineering Job Market Changed in 2025?
SSi People
June 11, 2025
Over the past six months, the engineering industry has given job seekers mindful optimism due to the rapid evolution of AI, shifting employer hiring practices and demands, and rising opportunities for work. The engineering job market is a significant source of optimism, aligning with the
Bureau of Labor Statistics
, which projects architecture and engineering occupations will grow faster than the average of all occupations over the next decade.
So, what are the engineering job market trends that are driving this growth through 2025 and beyond?
The Business of Engineering
In their first quarterly report for 2025,
The American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC)
reported that on average, 9% of engineering positions remain unfilled, which is one point more than the previous quarter. Additionally, the
ACEC predicted that 75% of engineering firms will experience an increase in hiring over the next 12 months
. This data suggests that the engineering job market is experiencing sustained growth and opportunity, which is especially reassuring for engineers searching for jobs amidst the rapidly evolving industry changes.
Adding to the optimism in the
engineering job market
, there has been a notable demand for engineers across various industries. For example:
According to the World Economic Forum’s
Future of Jobs Report 2025
, some of 2025’s fastest-growing roles include
Fintech Engineering, Environmental and Renewable Energy Engineering, and Electrotechnology Engineering
Companies involved in automation, including those that utilize machinery and robotics, are also aggressively searching for engineers with technical skills as more products are being manufactured with AI and other smart technologies.
A Shift in Employer Demands
Amidst increased return-to-office work policies in place and a shift to hybrid work environments. There are some segments of the engineering field, such as mechanical engineers, that still see their fair share of
remote work
. Additionally, many job postings for engineers that require hands-on, in-person work will specify hybrid or on-site days, indicating a growing trend of allowing
engineers to set flexible schedules
.
Along with where engineers sit for work, there has been a significant trend among IT and engineering employers this year in prioritizing hiring skills rather than qualifications. Particularly for technology-based engineers,
skills-based hiring
has enabled tech companies to address their talent shortages by opening the door to candidates who may not possess all the qualifications but exhibit the necessary skills required for the job.
This hiring strategy doesn’t always directly correlate to traditionally trained engineers. However, there has been a growing trend for engineers to complement their strong foundational skills in engineering with crossover skills from other disciplines, augmented explicitly with technical skills. It is known as the
T-Shaped Skills Model
, and
engineering
is a prime example of having specialized knowledge as your base, with overarching supplemental skills to support that knowledge and the work at hand.
Not only does skills-based hiring widen the talent pool, but it also allows companies to fill skill gaps, enabling them to leverage their technical innovation and gain a competitive advantage over competitors as they rapidly develop new products. This means that aspiring tech and IT engineers have an opportunity to secure a competitive position, as employers are shifting their emphasis from traditional qualifications to the various skills candidates possess.
AI Impacts the Engineering Job Market
There is significant discussion revolving around artificial intelligence (AI) and its many implications for the job market. Fortunately for engineers, AI presents an opportunity for more work and job positions. Specifically, the
ACEC
noted in their first quarterly report for 2025 that the rise of data centers will have a positive effect on engineering jobs soon. The development of private data centers will require talent to support the growing capabilities of AI, with the engineering job market reaping the positive benefits of these recent developments.
Moreover, in the same quarterly report, the
ACEC
found that
78% of engineering firms believe that AI will have a positive impact on their firm in the coming year
. Tech and engineering employers are anticipating prosperity due to AI and will be more likely to increase their hiring of engineers within the next six months to a year.
The engineering job market is well-positioned for a period of positive growth, not only in the tech and IT industry, but also in the finance, environmental, and automation industries, among others. Coupled with the addition of AI, the engineering job market will experience new job opportunities in a developing field. As we head into the second half of 2025, the field of engineering is forecasted to have optimistic sentiments, providing candidates searching for a position positive reassurance and those already in the industry an opportunity to grow.

2. Supply chain disruptions
Engineering firms continue to be frustrated by the long-lasting impacts of COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, which make it extremely difficult to accurately forecast project needs and lead times. Material availability and costs can vary dramatically over short periods of time, which negatively impact production schedules, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability. One of the largest market disruptions in 2023 could be related to the transition to A2L refrigerants from hydrofluorocarbons for cooling applications, possibly causing refrigerant shortages. Engineering firms are also looking at redundant procurement systems to create more reliability.
3. Having enough skilled engineers
With the upsurge in new business as COVID-19 fades, many engineering firms are busy trying to fill open engineer positions so they can finish projects on time and take on more projects. Many engineers quit during the Great Resignation to find different jobs, or permanently retired from the business. In manufacturing, for example, the acute shortage of experienced engineers is slowing down production and creating bidding wars for top talent. This makes it even more important for human resources and the C-Suite to attract and hire top talent. This typically involves generous salaries and benefits and providing the latest technologies and software, professional development opportunities, and in-house upskilling and training.
4. Sustainability
There is growing pressure on engineering firms to adopt sustainable practices, including best practices for the supply chain and internal operations. Customers are becoming more aware of sustainability and want manufacturers, developers, and engineering firms to reduce their carbon footprints. This in turn could lead to new approaches for projects, designs, and business models. Companies are creating dedicated sustainability positions to oversee compliance with environmental standards or regulations, especially those for carbon emissions  and energy conservation. This often requires capital investment for energy infrastructure and more efficient production equipment.

5 Things to Know Before Opening a Consulting Business
5. High customer expectations
Consumers learned how to shop on the internet during the COVID-19 pandemic and have become accustomed to the almost instantaneous speed of purchasing and delivery. This also carries over into the business world, where customers want fast results from their engineering partners and have little sympathy or patience for the complexities and delays related to the supply chain. Customers also want their architects and engineers to produce quality outcomes regardless of project complexity or tight deadlines. Engineering firms that pro-actively respond to these expectations will have better customer relationships and brand reputation.
6. Technology implementation
Speed and quality are the two top priorities that customers expect from their engineering and construction partners. To meet these demands, engineering firms must invest in Industry 4.0/Internet of Things technologies to stay competitive and boost efficiency. In particular, the combination of artificial intelligence and automation make for better product designs and “smart” production lines. Having technology is one thing—using it effectively is something else. Engineering leaders must be prepared to invest in a technology adoption plan (often developed with the help technology consulting firms) and the necessary workforce training to launch fast and effective technology upgrades.
Overall, engineering firms are cautiously optimistic about 2023 and the challenges they must navigate. Supply chains are starting to stabilize, which makes forecasting and inventory management easier and more reliable. This “settling down” will lead to faster project development and increased customer demand for speed—which could be a problem if companies are still short of mechanical engineers to handle the increase in business. Executives must be strategic in their deployment of technology resources and the development of hybrid business models to increase operational performance and throughput.
Mark Crawford is technology writer in Corrales, N.M.
Business challenges that engineering firms will face in 2023 include inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, sustainability, high customer expectations, and technology implementation.

ENR 2025 Top 500 Design Firms Preview
The Trump administration’s plan to take its “America First” agenda global had a rocky start as the president’s sweeping tariff announcements tanked stock markets worldwide. Although the full scope of tariffs has since been paused, ripples of economic uncertainty have roiled the design market, say Top 500 firms. As some owners brace for a change of tide, designers say they’re rising to the occasion with more flexibility.

Hiring & Talent Strategy
Engineering 2025: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Role of Recruiting in Shaping the Future
Posted on
January 13, 2025
January 6, 2025
by
MRINetwork
Late in 2024, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a
report
on the future of engineering as a career. The data included in the BLS’ Occupational Outlook Handbook for Engineering indicates that demand for engineers will grow by at least 13% through 2031. So, why is engineering suddenly one of the hottest career fields around?
The answer lies in two competing yet related trends seen across industries. One is a continued emphasis on sustainability, as companies of all sizes prioritize environmental consciousness in a bid to be good corporate citizens and better attract the emerging Gen Z workforce. The other is the need for innovation across all industries, as
emerging technologies
like generative AI speed up the pace of market transformation.
That’s not to say that engineers will have it made over the next few years. While they are in high demand, they face a number of challenges in balancing cost efficiency with sustainable practices. As always, recruiters must also deal with significant challenges, but there’s also a rare opportunity to help shape the future. Here’s a look at the 2025 trends for engineering and recruiting.
Opportunities for Engineers in 2025
Much of the demand for engineers stems from a need to advance renewable energy technologies. The marketplace and governments seem ready to embrace alternative energy, including solar, wind, and hydrogen. From improving solar panel efficiency to optimizing wind turbine structures, engineers have an opportunity to lead the transition to clean energy.
However, sustainability doesn’t just mean clean energy. Engineers are also called upon to design eco-friendly infrastructure, such as energy-efficient buildings, sustainable transportation systems, and clearer waste management solutions. Smart cities may still be a concept, but many believe integrating IoT and AI into urban planning can make them a reality, yet another opportunity for engineers.
To make the future of clean energy a reality, engineers must push forward the development of sustainable materials. Biodegradable plastics and durable composites will be critical in a future world where sustainability is the norm. Today’s engineers can introduce these new materials into sectors like packaging and
construction
to pave the way for sustainability.
Challenges Engineers Will Face
Perhaps the biggest challenge engineers will face in their efforts to promote sustainable materials and related manufacturing processes is ongoing raw material shortages and
post-pandemic
supply chain disruptions. To overcome material shortages, they will have to look toward innovative solutions found in new recycling technologies or practice a new form of resource optimization.
However, the pursuit of sustainability often comes with
increased costs
. Engineers will have to find ways to balance the expense of environmental considerations with the economic realities businesses face today. Each new solution must be cost-effective, optimizing energy consumption while minimizing environmental impact. Evolving regulations and environmental standards will complicate matters here, but engineers who stay updated on the changes can successfully navigate stricter requirements.
Finally, the rapid adoption of AI and other new technologies means engineers must continuously upskill and reskill to stay relevant. Embracing the latest trends in gen AI, data analytics, and other digital tools that have traditionally been outside the purview of engineers is now a requirement.
Implications for Recruiting and Staffing
As recruiting and staffing teams navigate these 2025 trends for engineering, they’ll find they have to shift focus toward talent with niche skills. Instead of engineering generalists, recruiters will be looking for renewable energy engineers or those with experience in AI and machine learning. Sustainable design engineers with knowledge of eco-friendly materials and economic principles will be valuable in this talent marketplace.
It’s important not to overlook upskilling and reskilling during industry shifts like this. Identifying skills gaps and providing training programs to overcome them can create a culture of continuous learning to offset recruiting difficulties. New or pre-existing
talent pipelines
can also provide engineering candidates who haven’t yet hit the talent marketplace.
Leveraging staffing agencies for interdisciplinary talent can also help. With the right partner, you might find engineers with cross-foundational knowledge, such as civil engineering and AI. IoT or robotics specialists can also help with difficult-to-fill roles, and the right staffing partner can assist in locating this type of talent.
What to Do if You’re in an Engineering Industry
For companies in engineering industries facing the increased demand for talent, here are three things you can do now to prepare for 2025:
Partner with experienced recruiters to identify the top talent aligned with sustainable innovation goals.
Invest in training programs for emerging technologies and changing regulations to encourage upskilling and reskilling at your organization.
Focus on employer branding to attract engineers passionate about sustainability and innovation. The top talent will have multiple options, and this is an opportunity to position your company as the right choice.
The need for a new breed of innovative engineers will likely remain one of the top 2025 trends throughout the entire year. Engineering is at the forefront of solving today’s critical challenges and shaping a sustainable future. Recruiting can also play a part in shaping the future. To work with an experienced recruiter to build a workforce capable of driving sustainable innovation in 2025 and beyond,

To keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius,
we need to cut emissions in half by 2035—even as we will likely hit another record for burning fossil fuels this year
. Still, the brilliant engineering demonstrated in this year’s winning projects provides hope that we can rise to the challenge. A new kind of thermal battery will allow us to decarbonize the heat that powers the industrial processes behind everything from cement to chemicals. Newly inexpensive lasers are helping turn ore into pure iron for steelmaking using renewable electricity. Food challenges have generated different types of innovation: Instead of hauling agricultural waste to decompose in the dump, why not create a harvester-style robot that can process it into carbon-sequestering, soil-enriching biochar? To fight pests, a technique called mRNA interference allows bioengineers to create a precision poison for a particularly troublesome beetle. The most miraculous achievement in food this year may be an AI-formulated vegan cheese that is actually delicious.
(Editor’s Note: This is a section from Popular Science’s 37th annual Best of What’s New awards. Be sure to read the
full list of the 50 greatest innovations of 2024

Grand Award Winner
Joule Hive “firebrick” thermal battery by Electrified Thermal Solutions (ETS): A cleaner 21st-century firebrick
Learn More
Though wind and solar costs are falling, battery costs remain a lingering roadblock to decarbonizing the economy. After all, the sun is not always shining, and the wind is not always blowing. This issue is particularly problematic for heavy industries like cement, steel, glass, and chemical production, which require very high temperatures and typically keep furnaces running 24/7. Burning fossil fuels to produce heat for heavy industry accounts for
about 17% of the world’s CO2 emissions
.
An impressive solution to this problem is the Joule Hive, a 21st-century application of a technology that dates back to the Bronze Age: firebricks, which store heat in insulated structures. The Joule Hive uses clean electricity to maintain temperatures as high as 3,270 degrees Fahrenheit in a shipping container-sized box full of hot ceramic bricks. Channels in the box dole out heat to factory processes via a cold air stream, which the Joule Hive heats up to near-flame temperatures. Nearly ten years of research at MIT resulted in tweaking metal oxides to perform as the Joule Hive firebricks. These bricks consist of certain compounds that are electrically conductive interspersed with others that provide insulation to contain the heat.

Unlike your old toaster, in which electricity combines with oxidation from the air to eventually burn out the heating element, the Joule Hive firebricks are already oxidized. This high-tech take on ancient technology lets the Joule Hive reach higher temperatures and requires less maintenance than competitors. A recent Stanford study found that if deployed widely around the world, firebricks heated via renewable electricity could
eliminate 90% of the fossil fuels heavy industry burns for heat
. For its first commercial-scale installation, ETS will deploy a Joule Hive at San Antonio’s Southwest Research Institute in 2025.
Mobile biochar farm robot by Applied Carbon: Gathering agricultural waste and turning it into biochar in the field
Learn More
Nine
of the ten companies that have removed the most carbon from the environment
use modern versions of an ancient method known as biochar. Heating wood scraps or particularly dense agricultural waste like nutshells in oxygen-deprived environments—a process called pyrolysis—turns the biomass into black carbon, also called biochar, that bacteria and fungi cannot further decompose. But there’s a scale-up problem: There simply isn’t enough dense wood waste to sequester billions of tons of carbon.
Applied Carbon’s breakthrough was to develop a new pyrolyzing chamber that can handle the prodigious waste left after corn, wheat, and sugar harvests, even though the piles of stalks, husks, and leaves are not very dense. The Applied Carbon robot pyrolizes the waste in the field, producing synthesis gas as a helpful co-product that the robot scrubs and then burns to help maintain temperatures over 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit in the chamber. Making the biochar in the same field where it will be deposited saves additional emissions and costs of driving the material to a central facility and back. Over the summer, the company deployed four robots into corn fields in the Texas panhandle to process the waste into biochar and sell carbon credits.
In the long term, the company plans to sell or lease larger versions of the robots, estimating that waste from the world’s row plants can sequester roughly 2 billion tons of CO2 as biochar each year. Co-founder Jason Aramburu half-jokingly likens his future vehicles to the Jawa crawlers from Star Wars—ones that scavenge for stalks and corncobs instead of dead robots.
Calantha by GreenLight Biosciences: Precision biopesticide using messenger RNA interference
Learn More
The Colorado potato beetle is one of the most rapacious and pesticide-resistant bugs, feasting on tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, and, of course, spuds. The bug has developed resistance to dozens of chemicals and causes about $500 million in annual crop damage worldwide. Rather than escalate the arms race of stronger and higher-dose chemicals to kill it, Calantha, created by GreenLight Biosciences, is a precision poison guided to interfere with the reproduction of crucial proteins in the beetle’s body.  The precision-targeted pesticide is highly effective. Even better, the researchers at GreenLight Biosciences combed through bioinformatic databases to find just the right gene to disrupt to avoid collateral damage to honeybees and other harmless species.
An application of work that won the Nobel Prize in 2006, Calantha consists of double-stranded RNA that farmers can “drop in” to conventional sprayers, like a typical pesticide. The beetle ingests the RNA, triggering interference by binding to messenger RNA instructions for a gene called PSMB5, which is critical for the elimination of damaged proteins. These mRNAs are then targeted for degradation in the gut cells of the beetle, causing damaged proteins to build up to fatal levels in the insect.
Despite its success, Calantha is not immune to the threat of beetles evolving an immunity, so GreenLight recommends that farmers rotate Calantha with conventional pesticides. Still, the company is betting that any technology that reduces chemical use will be a major driver of consumer acceptance. Calantha has sold out its first two batches and now has taken over 10% of the market for potato beetle pesticide.
Vegan cheese by Climax Foods: Plant-based blue, brie, and feta cheeses formulated by AI
Learn More
Cheese has a
worse greenhouse gas footprint than pork or chicken
, but until now, vegan makers haven’t been able to crack the code for flavor, texture, and overall deliciousness. To tackle this, California-based Climax Foods built a training set of metrics for cheese characteristics such as scent and stretchability. Then, they used AI and educated guesswork by cheesemakers to develop plant-based formulations that hit the same benchmarks as dairy cheese.
Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn said the resulting blue cheese, with top ingredients of pumpkin seeds, hemp protein powder, lima beans, and coconut oil, is “
beyond imagination for a vegan cheese
.” Climax became the first ever vegan cheesemaker to win a prestigious
Good Food award
—though dairy complaints caused the prize to be rescinded at the last minute, with shades of the protectionist, legal skulduggery
faced by non-dairy milk products
.
For now, Climax is trying to scale up to capitalize on the good press, though it has faced
furloughs while seeking additional investment “runway
.” The company has a licensing agreement with the “Laughing Cow” maker Bel Group and a second, still-unnamed producer. In the meantime, the blue cheese
is available
online and at select restaurants in California, New York City, and Las Vegas.

In 1985, a 1-watt laser cost about $1 million. Today, a laser of that same size costs just $1. Oakland-based Limelight Steel is capitalizing on this “Moore’s Law of lasers” to re-invent iron ore processing for steel to reduce emissions. After all,
75% of the world’s steelmaking industry still uses coal-fired blast furnaces,
and the industry as a whole accounts for about 8% of global emissions. The Limelight Steel process directs laser light via mirrors and lenses onto the surface of ore, raising it to temperatures above 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The proprietary set of conditions created by the lasers breaks the bonds between iron and oxygen in the ore without needing carbon or expensive green hydrogen to act like a bouncer that carries the unwanted oxygen away. Limelight then follows standard steelmaking techniques to create a slag of impurities at the top of the brew, allowing dense pure iron to flow out through a channel below. Finally, steelmakers alloy the pure iron with small amounts of carbon and other elements to make different grades of steel.
CTO and co-founder Andy Zhao says the lasers approach 70-80% efficiency in converting electricity into light energy. When powered by renewable electricity, the process produces 95% fewer emissions than
traditional steelmaking. Having used a
$2.9 million grant from ARPA-E
to demonstrate proof of concept, Limelight is now planning a pilot-scale plant in 2025 capable of producing 100 tons annually.

5 power electrical engineering trends 2023
Five Power and Electric Trends That Will Shape the Future
As technology continues its ever-changing wave of innovations and updates, engineers
                              must strive to stay ahead of electrical engineering trends.
Why?
Because the future of electronics influences several industries, such as automotive,
                              healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, banking and finance, retail, education,
                              energy, aerospace, and security.
In short, regardless of the industry, engineers will be responsible for pioneering
                              and building new ways of interacting with technology.
Read on for a summary of five upcoming trends in electrical engineering and electronics
                              to learn how you can both influence and prepare for the future.
1. Wireless Power Transfer
Did you ever worry about forgetting to pack your charger when getting ready to leave
                           on a trip? Or maybe you did forget it. This trend in electrical engineering eliminates
                           any need for concern or inconvenience.
Though still in its early stages of development and production, wireless power transfer
                           is a promising innovation for the future of electronics.
In short, wireless power transfer (WPT), also known as wireless energy transfer, is
                           the transmission of electrical energy from a power source to a receiver without the
                           use of interconnecting wires. WPT systems use time-varying electromagnetic fields
                           for energy transmission.
These systems ride along the same fields and waves as wireless communication devices
. Essentially, a receiver in a device picks up the power, which allows for contactless
                           charging, powering, and data communication.
Simple and Convenient
Developed by MIT physicists
, wireless power transfer power transfer eliminates the need for chasing chargers
                                    or untangling dozens of cords and cables. This technology transfers power to devices
through plastic, granite, wood, and even the air
.
Innovative Uses
If you think wireless power transfer is limited to your phone or computer, think again.
                           Electric vehicle charging docks, security software, and heart pumps have all been
                           discussed as potential use cases for wireless power transfer. In short, wireless power
                           transfer has transformed or will transform several aspects of our lives.
Smart Homes:
Wireless power transfer can be used to power a range of smart home devices such as
                              lighting, climate control, security systems, and more.
Automotive
: WPT can enable contactless charging of electric vehicles, providing a more efficient
                              and convenient way of powering them up.
Industrial
: WPT can be used to power industrial machinery and equipment, reducing the need for
                              wires and cables and increasing safety.
Wearables
: WPT could be used to power and charge wearables such as fitness trackers, smartwatches,
                              and medical devices.
Remote Areas
: WPT can be used to provide energy in remote areas where it is difficult to connect
                              to the grid.
2. Wearable Tech
While wearable technology is nothing new, its constant innovation and new iterations
                           require the industry to think on its feet (literally) to meet consumer demand and
                           to stay ahead of electrical engineering trends.
Heart Monitors for the People
Some would argue
that the original wearable tech piece was the first pair of eyeglasses
. But we’d suggest something along the lines of a step counter with a digital display
                                    or a Garmin sports watch. What began, then, as an activity-tracking device has spurred
                                    a whole range of wearable pieces that send and receive texts, make calls, and alert
                                    wearers of possible health conditions.
Forward-Thinking Fashion
But wearable tech is far more than just a watch or an electrical engineering trend.
                           It can become a life-saving device. Electrical engineers have been hard at work developing
                           wearable pieces that prevent injury and workplace accidents. For example,
SolePower boots
are specifically designed to eliminate on-the-job injuries. The boots contain technology
                           that monitor the wearer’s real-time location, environmental conditions, and even fatigue.
                           All in all, these boots are meant to improve situational awareness and improve safety
                           in the workplace.
Beyond boots, smart clothing is another form of wearable technology that incorporates
                           sensors and other electronics into fabric, tracking physiological signals (heart rate,
                           body temperature, and respiration) and providing feedback to the user. Some brands,
                           such as
Sensoria
, track user performance and activity metrics, such as heart rate, steps taken, calories
                           burned, and distance traveled. Others, like
Spire Health
, are designed to send ongoing, real-time health statistics to medical professionals
                           to monitor health conditions. Smart clothing can also be used to connect to other
                           devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
And there are other potential applications of smart clothing as well, such as tracking
                           location, helping wearers find help when they are lost or in danger, detecting injuries
                           and falls, and alerting emergency contacts.
3. Electric Power Distribution and Supply
Almost gone are the days of customer reliance on power from a single, localized power
                           company. Today’s power generation industry trends dictate a better, more efficient
                           way to generate power with smart grids and microgrids.
Smart Grids
A smart grid is an advanced power grid that uses digital technology to monitor and
                                    manage the flow of electricity to improve the efficiency and reliability of the electricity
                                    supply. Smart grids use two-way communication between the utility and the consumer,
                                    better managing the delivery of electricity and responding to changing demand. This
                                    trend in electrical engineering also allows renewable energy sources and storage technologies
                                    to provide a more sustainable energy supply.
Microgrids
A microgrid ""
consists of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources
"" that comprise ""a single controllable entity with respect to the grid."" Or to put
                           it more simply, microgrids are self-contained power sources that provide power for
                           smaller, community-based areas.
This grid can operate in two modes, island or connected, depending on need and a community's
                           power usage.
There are five types of microgrids
, which are used based on a community's location: campus environment, community, remote
                           off-grid, military base, and commercial. Microgrids have several advantages.
Reliability
: They can provide a source of power in the event of an outage. They can also help
                              reduce the frequency and duration of outages.
Cost
: Their small size and decentralized nature makes them more cost-effective than traditional
                              grid infrastructure.
Sustainability
: Renewable energy sources can be incorporated into microgrids, reducing dependence
                              on fossil fuels.
Efficiency
: They provide local power that is tailored to the specific needs of the area.
Scalability
: They are easy to expand and adjust to changing energy needs.
Power in the Hands of the Customer
Not only do microgrids and smart grids improve communication between power supply
                           companies and technology, but they also put the power in the hands of the customer—literally.
                           With smart grids, customers can generate their own power and sell their surplus currents.
Microgrids allow communities to generate their power on-site, when they need it
. This power generation trend has the potential to change the infrastructure of electricity
                           delivery as we know it.

4. Electric Vehicles
Despite years of mass production, electric vehicles still remain a trend in electrical
                           engineering that continues to rise in consumer popularity. Electric cars are becoming
                           mainstream offerings. Though charging infrastructure still needs to be developed,
                           many electric vehicle owners can find readily accessible charging stations in many
                           locations.
Consumers might even qualify for tax incentives or credits for purchasing an electric
                              vehicle
.
Global national governments worldwide are also accelerating the future of electric
                           vehicles by setting specific benchmarks. For instance, in the U.S., the Biden administration’s
                           wants half of all vehicles sold in 2030 to be electric. Furthermore, the Inflation
                           Reduction Act encourages companies to install EV chargers at their properties. Those
                           who do so can receive a 30% tax credit.
Record-Breaking Popularity
With electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla continuing to break records for production
                                    and market value, it's clear the future of electronics is in cars. As consumers become
                                    more conscious of sustainability and emissions, the popularity of electric vehicles
                                    will only grow. Several major automotive companies are also deeply invested in electrification:
                                    Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, and Stellantis are just a few of them.
Multiple Vehicle Options
Despite the name, electric vehicles offer more models than solely battery-operated
                           cars.
All-electric vehicles
: these models operate entirely on battery power, with no engine parts able to use
                              gasoline.
Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
: Plug-in vehicles offer gasoline and battery-powered fueling options and can operate
                              in an all-electric mode.
Hybrid electric vehicles
: Hybrid models run entirely off gasoline but use an electric motor to lower fuel
                              transmissions.
Innovation Potential
Rising consumer demand will expand the need for innovative updates and production
                           of electric vehicles.
Experts predict over 125 million electric vehicles by 2030
, meaning there’s not only potential for investment but also for electrical engineering
                           trends to influence future advancements.

5. The Internet of Things
If there’s one subject matter knowledge critical to the success of an electrical engineer,
                           it’s the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of connected
                           devices that can communicate with each other and with other devices. These devices
                           can be anything from phones and computers to sensors, actuators, and other electronic
                           components. Through the IoT, data can be collected, analyzed, and used to control
                           and automate processes.
Room for Innovation
Aside from IoT knowledge for routine maintenance and updates, this trend in electrical
                                    engineering continues to have immense potential for innovation. Some of the more notable
                                    companies who employ engineers with IoT experience include Amazon, IBM, Microsoft,
                                    Intel, Cisco, and Samsung. These companies, which offer a range of IoT services and
                                    devices, require engineers to design, develop, maintain, and support them.
Room for Improvement
While there are standard connections that consumers have come to expect, there’s always
                           room for improvement. Consider the upgrade from 4G to 5G. 5G networks, which are faster
                           and more reliable than 4G networks, provided faster download and upload speeds, greater
                           bandwidth, and lower latency. This upgrade allowed more devices to be connected to
                           the internet at once, and for these devices to communicate more quickly and efficiently.
                           5G also improved more advanced applications, such as augmented and virtual reality.
Still, the IoT has innovated electrical engineering in several ways, such as in the
                           following:
smart homes
smart cities
industrial automation
smart meters
home energy storage systems
As the future of electronics increasingly requires an internet connection, the IoT
                           is an electrical engineering trend that won't be going away any time soon.

Founders Talk
Our founders are at the heart of the Engineering Capital ecosystem.
We invest early. And we lead.
We invest in our founders before they even start a company.
Having successfully built a startup before, I knew what I wanted in an investor when I started thinking about vFunction. Ashmeet exceeded expectations—helping us even before we started in ways few investors can. Ashmeet brings a visceral understanding of technology combined with pragmatic wisdom on how to actually build a business from scratch, a  hard combination to find. If you want to start a true technology company, I recommend you speak with Ashmeet first.
Moti Rafalin, Founder & CEO, vFunction
Ashmeet is my “co-founding” investor. He was the first investor in Yotascale and has been an amazing source of practical wisdom that can sometimes seem contrary to ""convention"". Ashmeet's prior experience as a founder & CEO makes him an invaluable asset to a startup founder & CEO compared to investors who lack that experience.
Asim Razzaq, Founder & CEO, YotaScale
Ashmeet helped us start Baffle in a way no investor can. He introduced the idea as a challenge to me, introduced me to my co-founder, helped vet the idea, co-authored our initial patent, and then wrote the first check! He is unique amongst the many VCs in Silicon Valley with his intellectual curiosity that highlights massive opportunities, the access his powerful network creates for his portfolio, and his focus on a relentless pursuit of product-market fit.
Ameesh Divatia, Founder & CEO, Baffle
Ashmeet was my first Investor in Asimily. He has provided constant support, encouragement, advice, and fresh perspectives through all our ups and downs and continues to stay engaged. He is always there when you need him but at the same time, gives you the space you need to execute. We are lucky to have Ashmeet!
Shankar Somasundaram, Founder & CEO, Asimily
Ashmeet was the first investor to commit to invest in Robust Intelligence. We had lots of interest, and his creative, out of the box approach created a foundation for our cap table which paid off handsomely in later rounds. He has a deep understanding of all aspects of venture, and plays win-win which makes him a great partner.
Yaron Singer, Founder & CEO, Robust Intelligence
We understand technology deeply.
“Venture capital for engineers” is not just a tagline. We get technology in a way few VCs do.
Ashmeet thinks fast and moves fast, and he actually understands the tech he invests in. His product experience gives him a real edge in his ability to support and advise founders, which have resulted in an active community of builders forming around Engineering Capital. Ashmeet was the third investor in my company, but he's my first call when I'll raise money for the next one.
Avner Braverman, Founder & CEO, Reshuffle
Since TCP/IP was adopted as the standard for enterprise networking in the 1980s, the principles behind its design have been taken for granted. Airgap has key insights that aim to disrupt this status-quo. When we approached Ashmeet for our seed round of funding, we not only found a great investor, but a partner who understood the fundamental technical gaps, aligned with us on the breakthrough technology led innovation and, most importantly, was equally eager to disrupt the market. If you are looking for a seasoned investor with deep business skills, an engineer with deep technical background, and a partner you can trust, you must connect with Ashmeet.
Ritesh Agrawal, Founder & CEO, AirGap Networks
We build long-term working relationships.
We work hard for our companies. Multiple, successful CEOs have chosen to work with us again and again.
Ashmeet was the first investor and board member in my first startup, Altor Networks, and is also the first investor I chose for Menlo Security. He has been an advisor, a friend, a trusted confidant. Few investors have seen startups from truly a clean sheet of paper like Ashmeet has—and it shows!
Amir Ben-Efraim, Founder & CEO, Menlo Security
I met Ashmeet when I was running my first startup, HTBase. We didn’t work together then, but I still reached out when I started Shipa. I am so glad I did! Ashmeet led the pre-seed at Shipa, and has been an incredible help ever since. He knows how to add tremendous value, but with a feather-light touch. Never a burden, and yet always available to help. The Shipa journey is still being written so we don’t know what lies ahead. But regardless of what the future brings, I know I want Ashmeet as my partner.
Bruno Andrade, Founder & CEO, Shipa
Ashmeet was a natural choice to be my first investor at Auditoria. He was also a seed investor in Palerra, my previous startup, which was bought by Oracle; and given the winding, complicated road that startups go through, I knew there was no one better to start this journey with, as well as support us through our growth and evolution.
Rohit Gupta, Founder & CEO, Auditoria
Ashmeet was a small investor in StackStorm, but added value disproportionate to size. He is gifted in efficiently getting to the crux of any matter with speed and empathy. In addition to ongoing advice, he rolled up his sleeves and helped create our exit. I thoroughly enjoyed working with him and would do it again, in a heartbeat!
Evan Powell, Founder & CEO, StackStorm
Ashmeet thinks long term. He led the seed and served on the Board of my first startup, Azure Power. After the very first board meeting his feedback was “you are running a marathon, not a sprint”. Combining that with practical advice from the amazing diversity of his real-world experiences set us on a path to our eventual IPO on the NYSE (AZRE).
Inderpreet Wadhwa, Founder & CEO, Azure
I had multiple choices and chose Ashmeet to the first investor in FluxNinja after working with him as the first investor in my previous company, Netsil. Ashmeet is the best investor to start your company with. He started and built a company himself and knows what it actually takes to build a startup from scratch. He understands technology, moves quickly, and knows how to help founders in just the way they need
Harjot Gill, Founder and CEO, FluxNinja
(formerly Founder and CEO, Netsil)
My perspective on VCs changed a lot after working with Ashmeet. The deal would not have been possible without your guidance and support
Sanjay Kalra, Founder & CEO ShiftRight, Founder & CPO Lacework

Forbes Best Employers for Engineers 2025 List - Engineering Careers
EDITED BY
RACHEL RABKIN PEACHMAN
NOVEMBER 20, 2024, 10:00 AM
The demand for engineers in the American workforce is at an all-time high, with
recent analyses
reporting a
shortage of talent
, particularly of workers with skills in software, industrial, civil, and electrical engineering. There is also a critical need for engineers with expertise in next-generation technologies, such as advanced robotics and 3D printing.
What’s more, the gap between the supply of new engineers and the demand for their skill sets is only growing. A report—published by the consulting firm
BCG and SAE International
, a professional association of engineers—projects that the need for engineering skills will increase by about 13% until 2031, and the disparity between new engineering roles created and new engineers entering the U.S. market each year may result in one in three new roles going unfilled.
These workforce statistics put qualified engineers in the position to be selective about their job prospects. With that in mind,
Forbes
partnered with market research firm
Statista
to assemble our first-ever ranking of America’s Best Employers For Engineers, a list to help workers match their engineering prowess with employers that offer competitive compensation, challenging work, and an engaging environment.
To create the inaugural list, we surveyed more than 22,000 engineers working for companies with at least 1,000 people within the country. Respondents were asked how likely they would be to recommend their current employer, their previous employer (within the past two years), and companies they knew through peers in their industry or through friends or family who worked there. Current workers were also asked to evaluate their employers based on such criteria as: benefits, professional development opportunities and workplace flexibility. Data from the past three years of Forbes-Statista employee surveys was included.
Responses were tallied and analyzed, with data from current employees weighted more heavily than older data or than responses from past employees or people who had never worked at the company. Each employer was then given a score, and the top 175 companies made our list of America’s Best Employers For Engineers 2025, which is presented below.

2025 M&A Industry Update
As we navigate through 2025, the M&A landscape within the AEC industry continues to evolve. We sat down with Chief Acquisition Officer
Aaron Tippie, PE
and Director of Mergers & Acquisitions
Trevor Garfield
to discuss the current trends, challenges, and strategies shaping our approach to mergers and acquisitions.
Q: What are the current trends in the M&A industry?
AT:
The AEC industry is witnessing a continued high number of transactions, with certain forecasts suggesting around 450 deals will be done in 2025. While this year’s activity may not surpass the 493 transactions of 2022, it’s still indicative of an industry enjoying a high level of investor interest. In particular, private equity's (PE) involvement in the space continues to increase, whether as a pure play investor or sponsor of a strategic acquirer. The largest AEC firms are increasingly backed by PE. And, given that over half of firms actively held by private equity are approaching several years of maturity within their hold period, more of those firms will soon be returning to the market as new investors are sought. This presents a great opportunity for well-capitalized buyers to partner with strong companies that have been otherwise unavailable in recent years.
Figure 1: Annual M&A deal volume in the AEC industry remains near record highs, with 2025 projected to see around 450 transactions. (Source: Morrissey Goodale M&A Deals Database)
TG:
I agree. The AEC industry has continued to see private equity involvement rise, which inundates our space with capital and strategic resources. This raises the tide of sophistication across our industry, creating firmer competition when trying to grow a business either organically or inorganically. The challenging question to answer is how all this PE involvement impacts Westwood's purchasing of other businesses, and which industry segments will see the most activity.
Q: Which industry segments are seeing the most activity?
AT:
The hottest industry segments for M&A include transportation, water and wastewater, and nearly anything energy or power related, which drives a lot of interest and therefore higher prices. Many other segments of AEC remain great areas for investment, enabling continued growth of a diversified platform at much more reasonable prices.
TG:
To build on what Aaron is describing, the public markets have felt downward pressure since historic valuation highs in 2022 that sustained through the end of 2024. Currently, the valuation of public AEC firms has seen a 25% decrease since November 2024. While this seems like a big decrease, the public market is still at a healthy, sustainable valuation (the decrease is pegged to all-time highs). However, this decrease has pushed the market to pick and choose where they want to 'lean in' when purchasing an asset. Firms are paying very high premium pricing for businesses with access to the end markets most likely to outperform when there is volatility in the broader macro-environment. This is how we get the answer to your question: pricing pressure leads to pricing competition in certain industries for certain firms. These firms focus on power (T&D, substation), water/wastewater, aviation, and, to a lesser extent, transportation. At the other end of the spectrum, we are seeing a stabilization of valuation in assets that are more heavily tied to privately funded new construction projects, like land development-focused firms.
Q: Have there been any surprises in M&A activity this year?
AT:
For some marketed processes, the sheer number of bidders involved and the incredibly high prices being offered for certain firms, despite actual performance of the business, soundness of strategy, or quality of leadership. This is often specific to the ""hottest"" industry segments mentioned above.
TG:
I concur. Marketed processes remain incredibly crowded, and valuations for certain firms are sky-high. This is nothing new. M&A at Westwood continues to operate as a well-oiled machine, and I continue to be impressed by our ability to stay disciplined, focused, and culture-first when approaching M&A. We have a great team, and we continue to find great firms like
CSRS, a Westwood company
, that can uniquely position our firm to outperform culturally and operationally.
Q: How have recent economic, political, and regulatory conditions impacted M&A activity?
AT:
Short-term economic uncertainty can influence firms' decisions on when to sell. We've observed some hesitance among private equity portfolio companies nearing the end of their hold period. Regulatory changes that result in a cooling of renewable energy implementation could have a near-term effect of reducing demand and therefore the price of firms with significant exposure to those markets.
TG:
Time will tell. Short-term uncertainty can impact the decision matrix of firms relating to when they should sell. We have seen some of this on occasion with private equity portfolio companies that are “long in tooth” or nearing the end of their hold period. If anything, we are seeing inflation normalize and wage increases taper off after a long period of record-high increases. This is healthy for businesses and can be helpful from a fundamental valuation standpoint.
Q: How is our organization adapting to the evolving M&A landscape?
AT:
We are being more deliberate about investing in creating relationships, in person, early in the process. Spending meaningful time with people is the fastest way to build trust, understanding, and set the path for a new partnership. Said another way, we are carefully cultivating relationships. Contrary to adapting to very quick, sometimes rash, movements in the market, maintaining fiscal and strategic discipline within certain corners of the industry will serve Westwood well in the long run.
TG:
We want to be consistent, deliberate, and disciplined. Relationships and culture are still number one. We want to form meaningful relationships with the firms we are pursuing. This takes time and must be prioritized in order for it to be successful. So far, so good.
Q: What strategies is Westwood implementing to stay competitive in the M&A market?
AT:
We are maintaining our genuine focus on investing in great leaders, compatible cultures, high-performing teams, and alignment of vision and strategic goals. This means saying no to many potentially viable deals, even if they work ""on paper."" Enabling business owners to speak directly with leaders who have joined Westwood via acquisition, in an unscripted and unfiltered environment, provides great credibility for our philosophy and approach. Our relationship with Blackstone can be incredibly helpful in making introductions and certainly provides a high level of credibility and proven performance among the community of PE-backed strategic buyers.

TG:
What Aaron is describing is critical. Leadership and culture come first. If we are aligned on the desired outcome for our collective firms and want the best possible outcome for our clients and our people, then we can meaningfully cultivate connections with the firms we pursue. This is essential for long-term success.
Q: What insights do industry experts have regarding the future of M&A?
AT:
M&A will continue to occur at a high volume for the foreseeable future as the AEC industry overall remains ripe for consolidation, with 10,000 firms in North America. The industry offers strong returns across multiple end markets, a continued runway for industry growth based on large-scale infrastructure needs and new business opportunities, and the increasing rate of PE investment and successful exits.
TG:
With the high volume Aaron is describing, we’ll continue to see healthy valuation across the board with some outlier valuations in specific sectors. As we talked about earlier, the buyer universe within our M&A landscape is laser-focused on assets that drive accretive growth and is willing to pay up for those assets.
Q: What is the focus of our M&A team for the remainder of 2025?
AT:
Our team will concentrate on supporting our recent integration while identifying and pursuing other partnerships across markets and geographies most complementary to Westwood's current business portfolio. Additionally, we are laying the foundation for acquisitions that may occur beyond 2025, as some partnerships require a longer investment of time.
Conclusion
As we move forward in 2025, Westwood remains committed to navigating the complexities of the M&A landscape with a disciplined approach. By focusing on relationships, maintaining strategic priorities, and adapting to market conditions, we are well-positioned to continue our growth and success in the AEC industry. With the continued support of our partnership with Blackstone and our proven track record of successful integrations, we look forward to identifying partnerships that will strengthen our position in the market while staying true to our culture-first philosophy.

Top 50 Contech Startups
What is a construction startup?
The construction industry has traditionally been passive in terms of innovation, digitalization, and new applications of technology. But not anymore.
Like in many other industries, the construction sector has entered into an era of change, where new emergent business models are driving its revolution. According to McKinsey & Company, the adoption of new digital technologies in the construction sector can enhance competition and productivity by almost 15%, so it is no wonder that in recent years many new players have emerged.
Construction technology (Contech) startups are just some of the new players helping the industry become more sustainable, productive, efficient, and innovative, and are transforming the way we have traditionally seen construction. That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the top 50 Contech startups to watch out for this year.
These are the best construction startups
This year our Top 50 list is more diverse than ever in terms of geography, technology, and the maturity of the startups included. We classified each startup according to the following categories: Green Construction, Enhanced Productivity, Construction Supply Chain, and Future of Construction.

How to Choose the Right Product Engineering Company
Selecting the perfect product engineering partner can make or break your project. To help you make an informed decision, here’s a deeper dive into the key factors you should consider:
‍
Define Your Goals and Requirements
Before reaching out to potential partners, outline the specifics of your project. Are you building a new product from scratch, enhancing an existing one, or solving a specific problem?
‍
Key Questions to Ask
What stage is your product in: ideation, development, or scaling?
Do you need expertise in software, hardware, or both?
What is your desired timeline and budget?
‍
Why It Matters
: Defining your goals ensures you communicate your expectations clearly, helping potential partners understand your vision and offer tailored solutions.
Explore How to Use Generative AI in Software Development for more on innovation in software engineering
Evaluate Expertise and Experience
The right partner should have a proven track record in product engineering, particularly in your industry. Review their portfolio and case studies to understand the types of products they’ve built.
‍
What to Look For
Relevant industry experience (e.g., healthcare, IoT, fintech).
Success stories demonstrating innovation and problem-solving skills.
Examples of overcoming challenges similar to yours.
‍
Pro Tip
: Ask about their most complex project and how they handled it. This will give you insight into their ability to tackle unexpected hurdles. Also, consider their understanding of industry standards. For example, familiarity with the

Check Technical Capabilities
Technical expertise is non-negotiable. Your partner should be proficient in your project's tools, technologies, and frameworks.
‍
Consider These Factors
Do they specialise in cutting-edge technologies like AI, ML, IoT, blockchain, or cloud platforms?
Are they certified or partnered with major tech providers (e.g., AWS, Microsoft, or Google)?
Can they provide prototypes or proof of concepts?
Do they follow best practices in cybersecurity?
‍
Why It Matters
: A company with the right technical skills can ensure your product is robust, scalable, and future-proof.
‍
Assess Communication and Collaboration
Clear and consistent communication is key to avoiding misunderstandings and keeping your project on track.
‍
What to Evaluate
How quickly do they respond to inquiries?
Are they proactive in suggesting improvements or solutions?
Do they have dedicated project managers or agile workflows?
‍
Practical Tips
: Request a trial project or initial consultation to gauge how well they listen, respond, and work with your team.
‍
Understand Their Scalability
Your needs change over time, so you’ll want a partner to scale resources up or down as needed.
‍
What to Check
Do they have a large enough team to handle bigger workloads?
Can they quickly adapt to new requirements or technologies?
Are their systems and processes flexible enough to accommodate growth?
‍
Why It’s Important
: A scalable partner can prevent you from switching providers as your business grows, ensuring continuity and consistency.
‍
Read Reviews and Testimonials
Nothing speaks louder than feedback from real clients. Reviews provide a snapshot of a company's operations and the value it delivers.
‍
Where to Look
Online reviews on platforms like Clutch, GoodFirms, or Google.
Testimonials on the company’s website (verify their authenticity).
Direct conversations with past clients (ask for references).
‍
What to Focus On
How well did they meet deadlines and budgets?
Were clients satisfied with the communication and results?
Did the company go above and beyond expectations?
‍
Prioritise Cultural Fit
Technical expertise and the alignment of values, culture, and work style are critical. A strong cultural fit fosters better collaboration and long-term success.
‍
Key Considerations
Do they understand your industry and business goals?
Are they proactive, flexible, and innovative in their approach?
Do their leadership and team values align with yours?
‍
How to Test This
: During your initial conversations, look for signs of compatibility in how they work and solve problems. Cultural fit often drives long-term success. Refer to
Top 10 Tech Stacks for Software Development
to evaluate alignment in technical and cultural values.
‍
Consider Cost and ROI
While choosing the lowest bid is tempting, the focus should always be on value rather than cost. A higher upfront investment often leads to better long-term results.
‍
Evaluate Costs Against Value
How do their prices compare to competitors?
What additional services or benefits do they offer?
Can they provide clear ROI projections?
‍
What to Ask
Are there hidden costs beyond the quoted price?
How do they measure success, and what KPIs will they track?
Are their solutions designed to minimise future maintenance costs?
‍
Why It Matters
: A partner offering a better ROI through quality, innovation, and efficiency will deliver greater value than a cheaper, lower-quality alternative.
‍
Here's a detailed checklist to help you make an informed decision:
‍
Benefits of Partnering with a Product Engineering Company
Collaborating with a product engineering company offers more than just technical expertise—it’s a strategic decision that can transform your business. Here are the key benefits of working with these specialised partners:
‍
Access to Specialised Expertise
Product engineering companies bring deep technical knowledge and a multidisciplinary team of experts. Whether it’s software development, hardware integration, or emerging technologies like AI and IoT, they have the skills to handle complex challenges.
‍
Why It’s Valuable
: Instead of building an in-house team, you gain access to professionals who have already mastered the required tools and methodologies.
Read more about accelerating development in the Mastering Software Architecture Guide for Managers
Faster Time-to-Market
Speed is a competitive advantage. Partnering with a product engineering firm allows you to leverage their streamlined processes, pre-existing frameworks, and tested workflows.
‍
What This Means for You
Accelerated product development cycles.
Quicker iterations and deployment of updates.
An edge over competitors by launching ahead of schedule.
‍
Focus on Core Business Activities
With a trusted partner managing your product engineering needs, your internal teams can concentrate on their strengths: strategy, marketing, and operations.
‍
Why It Matters
: Delegating complex technical work frees up resources and reduces the strain on your team, improving overall productivity.
‍
Cost-Effectiveness
While there’s an upfront investment, outsourcing product engineering often saves money in the long run. You avoid the costs of recruiting, training, and maintaining a full in-house engineering team.
‍
Additional Cost Benefits
Access to cutting-edge tools and infrastructure without purchasing them yourself.
Reduced risk of costly errors thanks to experienced professionals handling your project.
‍
Scalability and Flexibility
Product engineering companies can scale teams and resources according to your project’s needs. They can adapt to your requirements, whether you’re starting small or rapidly expanding.
‍
How This Helps
Efficiently manage fluctuating workloads.
Add specialised talent on-demand without long-term commitments.
‍
Enhanced Innovation
With their experience across industries, product engineering companies can offer fresh ideas and innovative solutions. They often introduce best practices and novel approaches you might not have considered.
‍
Examples of Innovation
Integrating AI for smarter product features.
Using data analytics to improve user experience.
Employing sustainable design techniques for eco-friendly products.
Discover more about quality assurance techniques in Best DevOps Tools to Improve Workflow and Security.
Improved Product Quality
A professional product engineering partner ensures that every aspect of your product meets the highest standards. They perform rigorous testing, quality assurance, and compliance checks to minimise risks and errors.
‍
Key Benefits
Reliable, user-friendly products that meet market demands.
Long-term performance and reduced maintenance issues.
‍
Mitigation of Risks
Experienced product engineering firms are skilled at identifying and managing risks throughout development. They anticipate potential pitfalls and implement proactive solutions.
‍
Why It’s Important
: Reducing risks upfront saves time, money, and frustration later in the project.
‍
Global Market Readiness
Many product engineering companies have experience with international markets. They can help you design products that meet different regions' regulatory and cultural requirements.
‍
How This Adds Value
: Expanding your product’s reach becomes easier and more efficient, ensuring a seamless global launch.
‍
Long-Term Partnership Opportunities
A strong relationship with a product engineering company can evolve into a strategic partnership. They become an extension of your team, helping you innovate and grow over time.
‍
Why It Matters
: A reliable partner better equips you to handle future challenges, adapt to new technologies, and continuously improve your offerings.

Your Next Steps in Choosing a Product Engineering Company
Now that you understand the key factors to consider and the benefits of partnering with a product engineering company, it’s time to take action. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you move forward and find the perfect partner for your business:
‍
1. Clarify Your Needs
‍
Before reaching out to any company, take the time to define what you’re looking for clearly.
‍
What to Do
Write a detailed project brief outlining your objectives, timeline, and budget.
Specify the skills, technologies, and services you need.
‍
Why It Matters
: Clarity saves time during initial discussions and helps you focus on the most suitable candidates.
‍
2. Shortlist Potential Companies
‍
Use the information from this blog and your research to create a list of potential partners.
‍
How to Start
Look for companies with expertise in your industry or niche.
Explore rankings, reviews, and case studies to evaluate their capabilities.
‍
Pro Tip
: Narrow your list to 3–5 companies to avoid decision fatigue while ensuring you have options.
‍
3. Reach Out and Assess Compatibility
‍
Begin initial discussions to determine whether a company meets your requirements and expectations.
‍
Key Steps
Schedule consultations or meetings to discuss your project.
Ask for insights on how they would approach your product engineering needs.
‍
What to Watch For
Do they demonstrate a clear understanding of your goals?
Are they proactive in suggesting innovative ideas or solutions?
Do they communicate effectively and seem easy to work with?
‍
4. Review Proposals and Estimates

Request detailed proposals from your shortlisted companies that outline their approach, timeline, costs, and deliverables.
‍
What to Look For
Transparent pricing with no hidden fees.
A clear roadmap for how the project will progress.
Metrics they will use to measure success.
‍
Tip
: Don’t just choose the cheapest option—consider the value they bring to your project and the ROI they can deliver.
‍
5. Check References and Past Work
‍
Speak directly to previous clients or review detailed case studies to verify the company’s claims.
‍
Questions to Ask References
How satisfied were you with their work?
Were deadlines and budgets met consistently?
What were the biggest challenges, and how did they handle them?
‍
Why It’s Important
: First-hand accounts offer valuable insights into what working with a company is like.
‍
6. Test with a Pilot Project
‍
If you’re unsure about committing to a long-term partnership, consider starting with a smaller pilot project.
‍
How This Helps
You can evaluate their processes, communication, and quality of work.
It’s a lower-risk way to ensure compatibility before fully investing.
‍
What to Expect
: A good company should view a pilot project as an opportunity to prove its capabilities.
‍
7. Finalise Contracts and Agreements
‍
Once you’ve chosen a partner, formalise your relationship with clear, well-documented agreements.
‍
Include in the Contract
Detailed scope of work, timelines, and payment terms.
Confidentiality and intellectual property clauses to protect your business.
Terms for handling changes or issues during the project.
‍
Pro Tip
: Seek legal advice to ensure your interests are protected.
‍
8. Maintain an Open, Collaborative Relationship
‍
After selecting a partner, keep the lines of communication open to ensure a smooth collaboration.
‍
Tips for Success
Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress.
Be open to feedback and suggestions from the engineering team.
Celebrate milestones to keep morale high.
‍
‍
Why It Matters
: Strong partnerships are built on trust, transparency, and mutual respect, leading to better outcomes.

What Are Some Recent Innovations in Electrical Engineering?
Advances in electrical engineering help increase the economy, improve safety and health care, solve global challenges, and make for a more connected future. Here are a few of the new technologies in the field.
Smart Grids
Smart grids
use digital communication and automation to manage electricity generation, distribution, management, and consumption. Traditional power grids are limited in their ability to adapt to real-time changes. Instead, smart grids use sensors,
smart meters
, and advanced communication systems to adjust to fluctuating energy needs. These grids incorporate renewable energy sources more effectively, as well, promoting a sustainable future. Smart grids also allow households and corporations to generate their electricity, meaning consumers don’t have to rely on traditional power companies—and may even be able to sell surplus electricity back to the grid.
Energy Storage Systems
Energy storage systems (ESS)
hold on to and later provide energy when renewable sources like solar and wind aren’t producing power. They promise a source of continued supply and a longer lifespan. ESS can come in a
variety of forms
: chemical (batteries), mechanical (pumped hydropower, flywheels), thermal (molten salt), and electromagnetic (superconducting systems). Advanced batteries enhance capacity, safety, and cost-effectiveness, making energy storage more efficient. ESS is helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, supporting clean energy, and helping nations achieve net-zero goals.
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI)
enhances efficiency, reliability, and innovation in electrical engineering technologies. AI uses
machine learning
to analyze data to proactively schedule maintenance on lots of equipment and machinery, minimizing downtime for many businesses. Fault detection systems use AI to diagnose issues in power grids; AI optimizes the energy flow to support eco-friendly solutions to supply and demand patterns. Beyond energy, AI-driven automation is helping food manufacturing industries maintain optimal food environmental conditions and is being utilized in areas like
circuit design
,
energy forecasting
, and more.
The Internet of Things
The
Internet of Things (IoT)
refers to the totality of devices that collect, analyze, and share data. These “smart” devices can range from thermostats and smartwatches to entire smart cities. IoT is essential in building smart grids, smart lighting, and other electrical engineering projects. For example, 5G technology has increased the adoption of IoT products, boosting innovations like
smart homes
,
temperature monitoring
, machine performance, and
good lighting
.
Electric Vehicles
Electric vehicles (EVs) play an increasingly significant role in the modern world, with innovations in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and power electronics. EVs have shorter charging times, improved battery lives, and efficient power usage, which, along with reduced emissions, makes them appealing to consumers.

The construction industry in 2024 was defined by strong fundamentals, marked by a 10% increase in nominal value added and a 12% increase in gross output.
1
Construction spending crossed US$2 trillion and maintained a balanced trajectory in the first half of 2024.
2
Despite facing a pervasive talent shortage, the sector’s employment level reached 8.3 million in July 2024, surpassing its previous peak of 7.7 million from 2006.
3
This number has been increasing steadily for more than a year now. The Dodge Momentum Index (DMI), a measure of nonresidential building spending, has been on a steady rise in the second quarter of 2024,
4
reflecting growing confidence in market conditions among owners and developers.
Nevertheless, the industry had its fair share of challenges. High interest rates and price inflation continued to affect the residential and commercial segments. The challenging lending market and ongoing weakness in billings of architecture firms are expected to continue through the year.
5
However, construction investment, largely driven by government investments, and an expected decrease in interest rates may provide relief to the industry over the next few quarters.
6
Looking ahead to 2025, there are reasons to be optimistic. According to the Deloitte analysis of the Oxford Economic Model, short-term interest rates are likely to decrease gradually over the next couple of years, following a 50 basis point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September 2024.
7
The improving economic conditions are likely to influence construction demand across various segments. Declining mortgage rates could boost demand and residential construction activity. Government investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act may continue to drive growth in segments such as manufacturing and energy.
8
Moreover, with the increasing uptake of artificial intelligence and advanced computing across industries, data center construction is also likely to gain steam. Overall, the US construction industry is likely to record moderate growth in the medium term with slowing inflation and a supportive monetary policy.
9
As engineering and construction (E&C) firms plan for the upcoming year, there are four key areas that may help them capitalize on the projected industry growth and tackle any unforeseen challenges:
Managing the labor mismatch: E&C firms will likely use a variety of strategies to build an agile workforce
Increasing technological integration: Evolving technologies can continue to transform E&C operations across the value chain
Financial considerations: E&C firms strive to drive growth from strategic divestitures, capital allocation strategies, and the growing role of private equity
Industrial policies: E&C firms are likely to remain agile in the face of an evolving policy landscape

1. Managing the labor mismatch: E&C firms will likely use a variety of strategies to build an agile workforce
The construction sector continues to grapple with a significant talent shortage. Between August 2023 and July 2024, the industry had an average of 382,000 job openings each month—a third consecutive year with an increased average close to 400,000.
10
The growing average job openings may be linked to increased spending in areas like manufacturing and nonresidential construction. This challenge is expected to intensify as the industry anticipates growth in the coming years, raising concerns about how to bridge the persistent—and now growing—labor gap.
Labor attraction is a predominant issue for construction firms, affecting both skilled and unskilled positions.
11
Securing onsite labor has been particularly challenging, and it is hard to recruit skilled workers.
12
The current landscape is further complicated by the construction of data centers, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and megaprojects that require specialized labor such as welders and electricians.
13
Estimates suggest that the construction of a large data center typically creates nearly 1,700 local construction jobs over a period of 18 to 24 months.
14
The engineering and construction industry is also witnessing a shift in skill requirements. For instance, 44% of the current skill requirements in infrastructure are expected to evolve over the next five years.
15
This is expected to further complicate the talent search as companies strive to fill gaps in both traditional labor skills and those required for a digital, more automated future. Demand is rising for digital skills such as data and analytics, cloud computing, and software development, alongside soft skills like people, business, and supplier management.
16
An aging workforce presents another issue, with projections indicating that, by 2030, the average age of craft workers will be 46 years.
17
Firms also face a perceived lack of interest among younger generations who possess different expectations when it comes to work and the working environment.
18
This creates a unique challenge necessitating a balance between institutional knowledge that experienced employees bring and the new skills and perspectives of younger employees.
19
The industry is likely to keep an eye on several important workforce issues in 2025. Talent shortages are likely to remain a key concern for the E&C industry. In particular, the increase of manufacturing construction and the continued build-out of data centers and energy-specific projects could put additional pressure on the industry. For example, skilled labor shortages and increasing construction costs could delay some natural gas projects on the US Gulf Coast. Additionally, industry players are likely to monitor the evolving blend of skills (technical, digital, and managerial) necessary to satisfactorily complete major projects.
The engineering and construction industry could consider a multitude of strategies to address these issues in 2025. Such strategies may include:
Integrating AI-enabled automation and digital tools:
These tools can augment workforce productivity by helping workers focus on high-value tasks. They could also help attract younger workers to the industry while aiding the retention of older workers by reducing physical strain and enhancing safety. Additionally, AI-powered technologies like robots or autonomous machines can be used in labor-intensive trades like drywall installation, thereby helping the workforce to perform more tactical jobs.
Offering more opportunities for career growth and diversification:
To combat high turnover rates, organizations can encourage cross-skilling and internal mobility through job rotation and cross-training. The use of experiential learning tools like augmented reality and virtual reality, for example, is one way to help workers build new skills. Training tradespeople and technicians on a variety of tasks and developing diverse skill sets is becoming more common, driven by a desire for a more consistent work environment, higher wages, and more challenging work.
20
Recruiting from outside of the sector:
Companies may also tap into alternative sources of talent, such as employees transitioning from tech and other sectors.
Creating partnerships:
Companies can focus on or scale up ecosystem partnerships with academia and government to help create a steady talent pool by offering apprenticeships and work-study programs.
2. Increasing technological integration: Evolving technologies can continue to transform E&C operations across the value chain
Digital tools and technologies are being explored across the value chain to enhance productivity, streamline operations, bolster safety, and improve the customer experience. Some industry firms are already using technologies such as cloud computing, IoT devices, 5G and private cellular networks, and AI in their operations. Now, they’re placing a new emphasis on scaling technology opportunities that range from the back office to project delivery and connected construction, digital twin, and elevating building information modeling systems.
Companies are leveraging digital tools and AI to increase their capacity and capabilities, aiming to offset labor shortages by using these technologies to help optimize a portion of work hours.
Building information modeling (BIM)
has been around for decades but is growing in sophistication with more efficient common data environments and the adoption of standards like ISO 19650.
21
BIM is being used to generate digital representations of buildings and projects, which can inform material choices and schedules, help coordinate clashes in models, resolve conflicts, reduce safety and sustainability risks, and keep projects on budget.
22
These tools also are helping companies gain capacity, giving them the ability to execute more complex projects efficiently and increase productivity from the deployment of BIM and prefabrication at scale.
23
One mechanical and electrical construction company, for example, has improved its margins by more than doubling its BIM designers and by investing in prefabrications.
24
Digital twin
technologies have allowed companies to focus on adding value through exploring their digital replicas, simulating and optimizing the construction process to make workflows smoother and differentiate themselves. One US-based multinational infrastructure consulting firm is automating using digital twins and augmented reality to streamline processes and alleviate labor constraints.
25
Companies are likely to continue building to a “whole digital twin” concept comprising the physical twin, the operational twin, and the intelligent twin (a predictive twin). The operational twin can provide an opportunity to help create data feedback loops between operations and engineering to improve the design for efficiency and safety, reduce downtime, and increase utilization. While many already incorporate the first two pieces, it is likely industry leaders will compete on the intelligent twin. The intelligent twin can help explore and identify complex patterns as it can interpret large data sets and is well-suited for AI and machine learning integration.
Robotics and automation
are increasingly gaining traction in E&C firms. Some firms are incorporating robots to transport materials autonomously, perform precise welding, plan layouts, and operate remotely in hazardous environments.
26
With the integration of AI, these robots can be adapted to new tasks, creating smarter construction sites and paving the way for a future where automated systems, humanoids, and collaborate robots (cobots) are commonplace,
27
working to ensure cost-effective and sustainable construction practices.
Beyond these, companies will likely invest in the
next wave of transformative technologies such as augmented and virtual reality, generative AI (gen AI) (over the next one to three years),
28
and even more autonomous gen AI applications like agentic AI
. Construction firms could continue to reinvent operations as these high-performance and cutting-edge technologies become more of a reality.
As companies continue to grow their spending and investments, technology can be explored in almost every aspect of operations. The wide adoption of drones, for instance, is facilitating precise surveying even when surveyors are not physically present. Companies have also experimented using drones for efficient inspection, inventory management, monitoring progress, and collating real-time information.
29
A home remodeling company, for example, performs drone inspections for better efficiency and real-time monitoring while keeping workers safe.
30
Emerging technologies are gaining traction within the sector and job sites are becoming increasingly interconnected and data-heavy, making digitalization crucial in the industry. Moving into 2025, companies should consider techniques to harness and analyze data to help make better decisions for future designs and project delivery.
3. Financial considerations: E&C firms strive to drive growth from strategic divestitures, capital allocation strategies, and the growing role of private equity
Against the backdrop of cost overruns due to elevated inflation and interest rates, E&C companies are expected to focus on creating value and sustaining growth through strategic divestitures, refined capital allocation, cash flow optimization, and increased private equity (PE) investments in 2025.
Large construction firms
31
may optimize their portfolios by divesting noncore assets, cleaning up balance sheets, and reinvesting in core business areas to enhance overall performance. Companies may limit financing for or completely exit noncore business units or product lines.
32
They may also look to optimize their geographic expansion. These strategies aim to enhance margins and drive targeted growth.
Many large firms may consider shifting from lump-sum contracts to reimbursable projects to improve earnings predictability and cash flow. Companies may also implement strategic cost reduction programs from shared service delivery to strategic sourcing and category management for materials and services to optimize cash flow. Owners are increasingly prioritizing projects in industries that promise higher returns on investment while minimizing short-term risks.
33
Somewhat conversely, smaller firms will likely seek market share and revenue growth, attracting interest from large firms as well as PE investors, presenting new opportunities for expansion.
Mergers and acquisitions activity will likely be an important growth strategy for both large and small firms. Between August 2023 and July 2024, there were 528 completed M&A deals in the construction industry, totaling more than US$38 billion, which is more than three times the deal value from the previous year.
34
Deloitte’s analysis of major deals revealed that construction firms are integrating vertically as well as horizontally. Vertical integration deals include acquiring companies within the supply chain (such as building products manufacturers and their suppliers) to enhance control over production and distribution. Horizontal integration deals include acquiring competitors or companies at the same stage of the value chain. These deals may also help companies consolidate market presence or diversify offerings by target product lines such as building products, cement and aggregates, steel, solutions for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, clean room solutions, and homebuilding services.
With increased governmental spending in sectors such as transportation, broadband, and clean energy, PE firms may pursue more buying opportunities in the construction sector.
35
Between August 2023 and July 2024, there were 112 completed M&A deals in the construction industry from PE investors, totaling more than US$14 billion, almost double the deal value in the previous year.
36
Deloitte’s analysis of major deals by PE firms in the construction industry indicates that they are primarily focused on strategic expansion and operational and technological enhancements. In the coming year, PE firms may seek to expand their portfolios and industry footprint by investing in construction technologies and automation. Solar technology, renewable energy, and clean energy construction projects also are expected to be prime prospects for PE investors.
As prices of construction materials have moderated in the last few months, E&C firms may find it easier to manage costs if this trend continues through 2025.
37
Effective resource allocation will be important as firms emphasize strategic investments to achieve sustainable results.
4. Industrial policies: E&C firms are likely to remain agile in the face of the evolving policy landscape
The engineering and construction sector continues to benefit from government investment. For example, since the IIJA was signed into law in 2021, total manufacturing construction spending has more than doubled.
38
Industry players are likely to continue to closely follow the macroeconomic situation and any policy shifts that could have an impact on the E&C sector, including federal investments. In 2023, there were 1,326 new unique recipients with US$2.15 billion of IIJA obligations, compared with only 542 new unique recipients with US$325 million of IIJA obligations from January 2024 to August 2024.
39
Actual spending has been increasing at a more moderate rate than the subsidies offered under these pieces of legislation.
40
Finally, E&C firms will continue to follow trade policy developments, such as the recent increase in tariff rates on various strategic materials like steel and aluminum,
41
which can have significant impacts on cost and delivery times.
E&C firms will likely continue to align their operations to capitalize on any government incentives and policies in the coming years.
42
Embracing changes to capitalize on growth opportunities in 2025
The E&C sector is not new to disruption and volatility, and evolving economic and regulatory factors are expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the upcoming year. Nonetheless, 2025 could present opportunities for continued growth. To capitalize on these opportunities, E&C leaders should keep a close eye on the following factors in their considerations for key decision-making:
Changing talent requirements:
The labor mismatch and evolving skill requirements need innovative workforce strategies, including automation, enhanced worker experiences, and diversity initiatives. The sector’s ability to adapt to an aging workforce, integrate new technologies, and attract new employees will be important in working to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving market and ensuring a robust and skilled workforce for the future.
Technological advancements:
Advancements in technology will continue to modernize the construction industry in 2025. The sector is more readily implementing technologies like BIM, digital twins, robotics, and automation. These technologies may help streamline project management, collaboration, and decision-making while reducing delays and costs. With wide-scale adoption, companies could experience improved productivity, safety, and resource allocation.
Market dynamics:
Changing economic conditions will likely be critical in shaping the construction industry in 2025. Lower interest rates and falling inflation may reduce project financing costs. This ease in financing will likely encourage both public- and private-sector investments in construction.
Evolving policy landscape:
Federal infrastructure investments like the IIJA will likely continue to benefit nonresidential infrastructure projects, including transportation, manufacturing, and utility facilities. The recent increase in tariff rates on strategic materials like steel and aluminum aims to boost domestic production capacity but also could potentially raise the risk of reciprocal tariffs.

MARKET OVERVIEW
The global engineering services market is a critical column of the infrastructure and industrial construction business, assisting in the design, planning, execution, and upkeep of complex projects globally. While much has been said on its current applications in construction, energy, transport, and manufacturing, what it holds for the future is far greater than its applications today. As nascent capabilities emerge, the sector will be transformed by a revolution that reimagines business, government, and society's interaction with engineering problems.
In addition to its traditional roles, the Global Engineering Services industry will increasingly become embedded within digital ecosystems. With the integration of digital twins, advanced simulation tools, and analytics, companies will be able to visualize and simulate solutions long before they take physical form. This change will not only reduce errors and utilize resources in the best possible manner but also shorten the lag between conception and action. These capabilities of technology will encourage a faster and iterative style, especially industrial design and infrastructure.
One of the most significant changes in the global engineering services market will be how companies approach sustainability—not as a matter of compliance but as an inherent aspect of every project. Engineering consultancies will begin to play a more advisory function, advising clients to adopt methods and materials that further long-term environmental and operational goals. Engineers won't be alone anymore; they will be accompanied by data scientists, environmental advisors, and policy experts to collaborate on developing wiser and cleaner solutions.
Geographical distance, too, will become less relevant as remote work and cloud platforms evolve. Projects that once required physical on-site visits and months of preparation will soon be controlled from different continents in real-time. This shift will introduce new issues surrounding cybersecurity, data ownership, and compliance, all of which the global engineering services market will need to confront head-on. Companies will spend money on more secure and robust digital infrastructures to protect intellectual property and sensitive project data.
Another order of change will come through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These will not only enhance productivity but also transform the nature of decision-making. Automated optimization and risk analysis programs will assist engineers in delivering more advanced results, especially in high-risk ventures like urban or national infrastructure renewal. As AI becomes more embedded in engineering activities, the field of human judgment will move towards direction, ethics, and innovation.
The competitive forces in the Global Engineering Services industry will also shift. New entrants will bring niche expertise, and established players will resort to mergers and acquisitions to stay relevant in a data world. Talent demands will force organizations to seek not only engineers with technical expertise but also professionals who can link engineering with strategy, technology, and sustainability.
In the future, the global engineering services market will not just respond to the needs of industries it will chart the course of how industries will be done. It will emerge as an engine of transformation, where technology, teamwork, and sustainability meet to redefine the boundaries of what's possible.
Global engineering services market
is estimated to reach $2,318,812.21 Million by 2032; growing at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2025 to 2032.
GROWTH FACTORS

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, staying ahead requires more than just innovation; it demands foresight and adaptability. Recently, we brought together over 100 leading technologists in the Bay Area for our third annual Engineering Summit: Future Proof. This year’s theme centered around preparing engineering organizations to embrace the future, focusing on critical topics such as engineering innovation under constraints, scaling teams effectively, and harnessing the power of AI.
The following are some highlights from our conversations:
Innovating Under Constraint
For the past few years, tech companies have entered a new reality of hyper-efficiency; engineering budgets are under increased scrutiny and each hire needs to be justified. However, unlike other functions which can trace investments back to a clear ROI, engineering can sometimes feel like a black box. So how do you lead and operate engineering organizations in the current macro environment where there is a constant need to do more with less?
Matt Eccleston and Mike Curtis, members of the ICONIQ Growth Technical Advisory Board, shared their experiences leading engineering organizations at Airbnb, Dropbox, and vmWare. They emphasized the importance in today’s reality of understanding customer needs, setting clear boundaries for project timelines and resources, and encouraging out-of-the-box thinking to boost efficiency.
It's also vital to invest in developer tooling. Most organizations do not pay attention to development tooling as a way to make themselves more efficient, and even those that do underestimate the leverage it can provide. Panelists argued that we should actually be utilizing ~15% of the engineering team to do work that can make the other 85% more efficient. In fact, people often underestimate how early you can get started; even at 10 engineers, two people can devote half of their time to thinking about how to streamline the toolchain and enable the team to move faster.
“Investing early is important as the pace of technology development will outpace the growth of an organization.  It sucks to work in a codebase where you have unexplained bugs, you don't know how abstractions work, etc. You want a code environment where it is fun and easy to write code. The harder it is to do that, the more frustration and unhappiness there will be.”
- Matt Eccleston (ICONIQ Growth Technical Advisory Board)
The Secrets of Scale
Each stage of growth raises new considerations and challenges for technical leaders. Anantha Kancherla, VP Advanced Driving Automated Systems at General Motors, and Ben Smith, Former Technical Advisor to Google CEO, delved into unconventional strategies for scaling engineering teams. They debated the merits of building teams with generalists versus specialists, and the importance of investing early in tools that can help scale engineering efforts.
Above all, they emphasized the importance of aligning organizational structure and teams to the product.
“You ship your org chart. At Dropbox, we used to say let’s align organization structure to the roadmap for the next year. Let’s not be afraid to have different leaders step up. This allows people to not get tied to egos or certain responsibilities. “
- Aditya Agarwal (Chair of ICONIQ Growth Technical Advisory Board)
It is also important for engineers to build empathy with end users. In the early days at Google, engineers would do one-week rotations with customer support, sales, etc. to get exposure to other roles and understand how what they are building is being sold and used by the world.
As the engineering organization evolves, so does the role of engineering leadership. As teams grow, it’s critical that engineering managers are well-rounded and able to talk to other teams like product and sales. Once the organization moves past 100 engineers, engineering leaders need to be thoughtful about communication. Everyone has a different style—maybe they are good at writing, communicating to the rest of the org, etc.—and this is when the role of an engineering leader transitions to focus on aligning the happiness of people with business priorities. Engineering can often feel like a mysterious black box, especially to non-technical leaders like the CFO or even the Board. An engineering leader’s responsibility is to understand where leverage points and inefficiencies exist in the technical organization and clearly articulate that in non-technical language to the rest of the organization.
You’ve Heard the AI Hype, Now Here’s the Reality
Of course, the impact of AI was top-of-mind at our summit. Keith Adams (ICONIQ Growth Technical Advisory Board), Anantha Kancherla (ICONIQ Growth Technical Advisory Board), Vishwanath TR (Glean Co-founder), and Nikita Shamgunov (Neon CEO) led our closing panel on the practical applications and realities of AI in engineering. The discussion revealed a variety of perspectives on the utilization of AI tools like GPT models and the strategic decisions companies must make regarding cloud services and GPU acquisitions.
""We are betting there will be multiple capable models, and we allow customers to specify models they want to use. We will likely see open-source fine tuned models used for specialized tasks and foundation models for general reasoning tasks.""
- Nikita Shamgunov (CEO of Neon)
The panelists also debated AI’s potential to significantly reduce code production time and enhance productivity, even as they recognize the challenges of integrating AI into traditional engineering roles. The machine learning space is still viewed as a specialized field and panelists agree that it is not feasible for software engineers to build ML models from scratch. As a company matures, it will be important to bring in ML researchers who can explore new ideas and approaches that the rest of the engineering team can productize.
""We don't want an exclusive AI team, we want everyone working with AI. The goal of the ML team is to create a platform so the rest of the product and engineering team can infuse the core product with different AI and ML features.""
- Vishwanath T.R. (Co-founder of Glean)
Our Future Proof Summit not only provided tactical solutions to current engineering challenges but also sparked broader discussions on the strategic and philosophical aspects of technology's future. We invite you to explore our latest research on the state of engineering in 2024 that further explores these issues and more, including building R&D teams, enhancing developer productivity, and hiring top technical leadership.
Join us on this journey as we navigate the future of engineering together.

Top 11 Startup Industries to Watch in 2025
The startup industry in 2025 is more dynamic and more competitive than ever before. Founders are navigating a landscape defined by emerging technologies, urgent global challenges, and
shifting investor priorities
.
While some sectors are rapidly accelerating due to breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence
or geopolitical demand for
defense innovation
, others are evolving more quietly, redefining infrastructure, healthcare, and enterprise operations from the inside out.
Below, we’re spotlighting the trending startup sectors that will shape the year ahead.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI continues to be a dominant player in the tech sector, and arguably one of the most successful startup industries of the decade thus far. In just the first five months of 2025, AI startups secured a record
$32.9 billion in global funding
, highlighting sustained momentum even with tons of uncertainty in the broader market.
Subfields like agentic AI are dominating early-stage investment. Startups such as
Cognition AI
are building AI agents capable of performing complex tasks on their own, with their flagship product, Devin. It functions as a fully autonomous software engineer, handling long-term reasoning, planning, and complex engineering tasks independently.
In March 2025, Cognition reached a
valuation of $4 billion
after a new funding round led by 8VC. In short? We’re seeing that investors are hungry for AI agents in enterprise.
Fintech
Fintech remains one of the best industries to start a business, with
more than 29,955 fintech startups operating globally
as of 2025. The sector is growing at an annual rate of 5.38%, with projections to reach a market size of
$686.85 billion by 2030
.
Fintech is driving innovation across both B2B and consumer markets through embedded finance, AI-powered risk modeling, decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, and advancements in real-time payment infrastructure. This startup industry is reshaping how money moves and how trust is built in today’s global economy.
Healthtech
Healthtech is experiencing a renewed surge in funding, with venture capital investment increasing
30.4% in Q1 2025, totaling $3.5 billion across 185 deals
. The sector is shifting toward preventative care and personalized health data platforms, often powered by AI.
Venture Atlanta 2024
speaker,
Catalyst by Wellstar
, is a prime example of
adapting AI to become more personalized
for patient plans and automating tasks for healthcare providers so they can spend more time with their patients. These emerging startup trends in healthcare are improving day-to-day efficiency for professionals and proving to be a top investment for founders.
Logistics
The logistics industry is undergoing a significant transformation, with the global market projected to grow from
$11.23 trillion in 2025 to $23.14 trillion by 2034
. This growth is driven by advancements in supply chain tech, the rise of e-commerce, and increased demand for efficient last-mile solutions.
Startups in this space are modernizing freight management, warehouse automation, and route optimization through technologies like AI,
the Internet of Things (IoT)
, and blockchain. Logistics is rapidly becoming a promising startup industry for tackling complex infrastructure and delivery challenges at scale.
Life Sciences
Life sciences is a booming startup industry, with the global market expected to grow from
$88.15 billion in 2024 to $239.56 billion by 2033
. These startups are leading innovation in biotechnology, diagnostics, gene therapies, and precision medicine.
Fueled by increasing demand for personalized treatments and massive investment in R&D, this sector is producing some of the most impactful and scalable innovations in healthcare today. As a result, life sciences remains one of the most successful startup industries with strong investor confidence.
Enterprise AI SaaS
Enterprise AI SaaS is reshaping how modern businesses scale, automate, and make decisions, evolving far beyond the debates about whether or not
SaaS is dead
. One sign of this momentum is
IBM’s $500 million Enterprise AI Venture Fund
, which launched in late 2023. The goal of this fund is to accelerate the growth of startups developing AI tools for real-world enterprise applications, fueling innovation across sectors like customer service, sales enablement, and operations.
Whether it’s AI-driven analytics, predictive ops, or workflow automation, this startup industry is addressing a massive market hungry for smarter, faster, and more scalable business tools. At our
Kick-off event
this year, Rob Bearden, Founder and CEO of
Sema4.ai
, explained that in the long term, he sees multi-billion-dollar companies being built and run with less than 100 people on staff due to the automation capabilities of AI.
With demand surging across sectors, enterprise AI SaaS is solidifying its place among the top-growing industries 2025 has to offer.
Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity continues to be a critical focus in the tech startup sector, with the market projected to grow from
$245.62 billion in 2024 to $500.70 billion by 2030
. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, demand for next-gen solutions has surged.
Startups are innovating with AI-powered detection tools, zero-trust frameworks, and proactive defense systems to meet the needs of both enterprises and government agencies.
Defense Tech
Defense tech is seeing a wave of venture activity, with investments reaching
$3 billion in 2024, an 11% year-over-year increase
. Startups are building AI-enabled surveillance systems, autonomous drones, and secure communication platforms that serve both military and commercial use.
A standout example is
Shield AI
, a San Diego-based startup that
raised $200 million
to scale its AI pilot software used in military aircraft. With its valuation hitting $2.7 billion, Shield AI exemplifies how dual-use innovation is attracting serious capital and accelerating U.S. defense modernization through the private sector.
Cloud/Edge/AI Ops (Infrastructure)
As data processing shifts away from centralized cloud environments, edge computing is expected to handle
74% of all global data by 2030
. This evolution is creating massive demand for startups that can build infrastructure at the intersection of AI, cloud, and edge.
These companies are enabling faster data processing, reduced latency, and AI model deployment closer to the source. For founders focused on long-term utility and resilience, infrastructure innovation represents one of the most foundational emerging startup trends.
Deeptech/Robotics
The deeptech and robotics sector is expanding rapidly, with the market projected to reach
$714.6 billion by 2031
, growing at a remarkable CAGR of 48.2%. This startup industry is pushing boundaries in quantum computing, AI-powered robotics, and next-gen sensors.
These innovations are already driving transformation in industries like advanced manufacturing, aerospace, and healthcare. With high technical barriers and big societal payoffs, this is one of the best industries to start a business for founders with deep domain expertise.
Space Tech
Space Tech continues to ascend, attracting over
$6 billion in annual venture
funding globally over the past two years. Startups in this sector are building everything from small satellite networks to orbital debris cleanup platforms.
Commercial applications like telecom and earth imaging are fueling investment alongside renewed interest in space exploration and defense. With both government contracts and private capital in play, Space Tech is a high-potential frontier for innovation.
Where Does the Startup Industry Go From Here?
Across every corner of the startup industry, innovation is accelerating. Whether it's artificial intelligence transforming enterprise workflows, fintech reimagining how money moves, or defense tech reshaping national security, 2025 is delivering urgency and opportunity.
Startups that align with these fast-moving trends, solve real problems, and scale with purpose will be the ones shaping the future of business and society. For founders and investors, this year’s top startup industries are more than hot sectors; they’re the blueprint for what’s next.

Artificial intelligence dominates this year’s list of 25 venture-backed startups we think most likely to reach a $1 billion valuation.

Editorial Operations: Elisabeth Brier
Reporters: Emily Baker-White, Jeremy Bogaisky, Moya Johnson, Richard Nieva and Rashi Shrivastava
T
his is the 11th year we have partnered with TrueBridge Capital Partners to scour the land for budding unicorns. To qualify, startups must be venture-backed, based in the U.S. and (currently) worth less than $1 billion. Unsurprisingly, artificial intelligence dominates this year—20 of the 25 companies are AI-focused, with applications in military, accounting and health tech. Pay attention to this list: Our track record is superb. Of the 250 alumni, 140, or 56%, became unicorns, including DoorDash, Figma and Anduril. Forty-two were acquired; only two went public for less than $1 billion. Just five—2% of our selections—have imploded or shut down.
Mike Monovoukas
AcuityMD
AcuityMD
Founders:
Robert Coe, Mike Monovoukas (CEO), Lee Smith
Equity raised:
$83 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$18 million
Lead investors:
Benchmark, Iconiq, Redpoint
If you want to build medical devices, you need patients. Boston-based AcuityMD helps manufacturers find the right physicians based on the patients they treat by using de-identified data (think surgical histories, medical referrals) for 325 million people to craft marketing plans. Customers include Synchron, which used it to find patients for a brain-computer interface preclinical trial, and Intellijoint, which did so to market a new surgical tool for hip and knee replacements.
Arthur Leopold
Agentio
Agentio
Founders:
Arthur Leopold (CEO), Jonathan Meyers
Equity raised:
$16 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$2 million
Lead investors:
AlleyCorp, Benchmark, Craft
There are lots of influencers on the internet, and finding the right one for an ad campaign can be frustrating and time-consuming. Enter New York City–based Agentio, which offers a marketplace of creators so brands can easily find which influencers will work best for them. It’s great for the creators too: They simply upload details about their upcoming YouTube videos to Agentio to sell ad spots to businesses such as Away, DoorDash, Mint Mobile and Uber.
Ian Cinnamon
Apex
Apex
Founders:
Max Benassi, Ian Cinnamon (CEO)
Equity raised:
$290 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$60 million
Lead investors:
8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, Point72 Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital
The U.S. military and companies like Amazon and SpaceX are racing to launch thousands of small satellites into low-Earth orbit. Los Angeles–based Apex wants to speed up the process—and cut costs—by offering a standardized satellite that buyers can trick out with their own sensors and instruments. It’s had early success with the Pentagon, winning a $46 million Space Force contract in February.

Assort Health
Assort Health
Founders:
Jeffery Liu (co-CEO), Jon Wang (co-CEO)
Equity raised:
$26 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$200,000
Lead investors:
Chemistry, First Round, Quiet Capital
Hospitals and doctors’ offices are con­tinuously overwhelmed by phone calls, leading to annoyingly long hold times for patients. Assort Health, headquartered in San Francisco, sells a text-to-voice artificial intelligence chatbot to search physicians’ calendars to match their openings with the type of appointment required. The software has cut wait times for millions of inbound calls to medical groups inclu­ding, among others, Chesapeake Healthcare and Peninsula Orthopaedic Associates.
Matthew Harpe
Basis
Basis
Founders:
Matthew Harpe (CEO), Mitchell Troyanovsky
Equity raised:
$37 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$350,000
Lead investors:
BTV, Khosla Ventures
This NYC tech outfit makes AI accounting software that can do clerical work in minutes, streamlining data entry tasks like transferring information from receipts. After adopting Basis’ software in 2024, accounting firm Wiss claimed a nearly 30% reduction in time spent on such jobs. Another big draw is the technology’s security features, which don’t store sensitive login details.
Ankur Goyal
Braintrust
Braintrust
Founder:
Ankur Goyal (CEO)
Equity raised:
$45 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$2 million
Lead investors:
Andreessen Horowitz, Basecase, Gil Capital, Greylock
AI promises business efficiencies, but how do you measure them? San Francisco–based Braintrust offers an all-in-one command center for testing and monitoring AI-powered apps, like keeping an eye on how frequently a chatbot gives incorrect answers. Customers such as Airtable, Instacart, Notion and Stripe use it to assess accuracy and figure out what went wrong when something breaks. CEO and founder Ankur Goyal, 35, previously founded AI search engine Impira, which Figma acquired in 2023.
Paul Klein IV
Browserbase
Browserbase
Founder:
Paul Klein IV (CEO)
Equity raised:
$68 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$1 million
Lead investors:
Basecase, CRV, Kleiner Perkins, Notable Capital
Goodbye, browsers: Browserbase wants to change how we interact with the internet entirely. Instead of clicking, typing and scanning information from websites, AI can do it for you, a concept known as a “headless browser.” Want to book a flight from Seattle to JFK? Instead of searching yourself, type a simple request into Browser­base and its AI will come back with the best options.
Surbhi Sarna
Cody Pickens for Forbes
Collate
Founders:
Jigish Patel, Surbhi Sarna (CEO), Nate Smith
Equity raised:
$30 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$0
Lead investors:
Redpoint
When Surbhi Sarna tried to raise funds for her ovarian cancer startup nVision Medical in 2012, she struggled to scrape together $500,000. After selling it for $275 million in 2018 and spending the next five years as a partner at accelerator Y Combinator, Sarna had no problem raising $30 million in seed funding for San Francisco–based Collate. It aims to use AI to automate the paperwork required for life sciences companies, such as that for clinical trials and FDA approval. “This stuff they would have spent months doing we can do over the course of days,” says Sarna, 39. Collate’s revenue is expected to reach $1 million this year.
Tomer Cohen
David AI
David AI
Founders:
Tomer Cohen (CEO), Ben Wiley
Equity raised:
$30 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$1 million
Lead investors:
Alt Capital, Amplify Partners, First Round Capital
Tomer Cohen, 27, and Ben Wiley, 26, believe that normal speech will be the main way we interact with artificial intelligence in the future. Their startup, David AI, supplies some 100,000 hours of high-quality voice audio in 15 languages to major tech firms, helping them build smarter AI models capable of understanding speech. They have a straightforward approach to getting all that data: David AI simply pays people to record it.
Dean Leitersdorf
Cody Pickens for Forbes
Decart
Founders:
Dean Leitersdorf (CEO), Moshe Shalev
Equity raised:
$53 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$20 million
Lead investors:
Benchmark, Sequoia, Zeev Ventures
Dean Leitersdorf has an ambitious goal: to build the next big all- purpose AI lab to rival OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. His entrant in the race is called Decart, a nod to René Descartes, the 17th-century French philosopher famous for the aphorism “I think, therefore I am.” “It’s the most AI thing you could say,” says Leitersdorf, a 26-year-old computer science Ph.D. He thinks recruiting mainly out of his native Israel will give Decart a chance against the giants, and its first product helps businesses squeeze more power out of AI chips. Last year, Decart went viral when its model Oasis generated a clone of Microsoft’s Minecraft game using nothing but AI.
(Boy, we’re good: Shortly after this list went to press, Decart became a full Billion-Dollar Startup after raising $100 million at a $3.1 billion valuation.)
Josh Araujo
Shawn Hubbard for Forbes
Forterra
Founders:
Alberto Lacaze, Karl Murphy
CEO:
Josh Araujo
Equity raised:
$303 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$30 million
Lead investors:
Hedosophia, Moore Strategic Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital
Engineers Alberto Lacaze, 55, and Karl Murphy, 65, spent about 20 years developing technology to retrofit more than 50 types of vehicles to drive themselves, including transit buses and military convoy trucks. Now the startup is cashing in, winning a $93 million contract from the U.S. Army to produce mine-clearing robots. It’s also part of a team buil­ding self-driving missile launchers for the Marines. Getting rid of human drivers both keeps soldiers out of harm’s way and drives down costs, says CEO Josh Araujo, 45, who took the helm from Lacaze in 2022, since you can ditch heavy armor and use a smaller engine. “You can completely reshape how you design those vehicles.”
Grant Lee
Gamma
Gamma
Founders:
James Fox, Grant Lee (CEO), Jon Noronha
Equity raised:
$23 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$16 million
Lead investors:
Accel, Afore Capital, South Park Commons
Former investment banker Grant Lee, 42, was inspired to start Gamma after spending years making traditional slide decks, often under time pressure and with little design support. Now his AI-powered software can spin up a slick presentation, website or social media post from raw text, documents or existing decks. Gamma says more than 50 million people globally have tried the product so far, and it has found early traction at companies inclu­ding Amazon and Zoom.
Merrill Lutsky
Graphite
Graphite
Founders:
Greg Foster, Merrill Lutsky (CEO), Tomas Reimers
Equity raised:
$81 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$2 million
Lead investors:
Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, Homebrew
New York City–based Graphite’s flagship product, Diamond, is an AI assistant to speed up code reviews, in which programmers make sure their work is up to snuff, by flagging potential bugs and suggesting improvements. It’s designed to understand context and reason about code like a human teammate, leading to adoption at fast-growing companies including Anysphere, Figma, Ramp and Shopify.
Victor Perez
Krea
Krea
Founders:
Victor Perez (CEO), Diego Rodriguez
Equity raised:
$83 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$5 million
Lead investors:
Abstract Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Pebblebed
As AI revolutionizes creative work, many visual artists find themselves overwhelmed by the array of competing products. Krea, a design tool built by a team of musicians, poets, designers and videographers, offers visual artists one place to access a range of AI models that can generate new images from text prompts, refine existing ones or enhance video. The startup has attracted more than 20 million users globally, including from teams at Lego, Pixar and Microsoft.
Jacqueline Reses
Lead
Lead
Founders:
Erica Khalili, Homam Maalouf, Jacqueline Reses (CEO), Ronak Vyas
Equity raised:
$110 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$170 million
Lead investors:
Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, Khosla Ventures, Ribbit Partners, Zeev Ventures
In 2022, former Square human resources chief Jacqueline Reses, now 55, and a team of investors acquired a nearly century-old com­munity bank with the goal of transforming it into a fintech startup. That business, Kansas City, Missouri–based Lead Bank, is now one of the few FDIC-insured financial institutions that issue loans and process payments for fintechs and crypto startups. It recently launched a stablecoin debit card with Visa and payments platform Bridge.
Russ d’Sa
LiveKit
Livekit
Founders:
Russ d’Sa (CEO), David Zhao
Equity raised:
$82 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$5 million
Lead investors:
Altimeter Capital, Redpoint
When you use voice mode on ChatGPT, your phone connects to a LiveKit server. The San Francisco–based startup provides the technical back end to enable real-time audio and video for a bunch of applications, including roughly 25% of 911 emergency calls in the U.S. In all, it’s used by almost 125,000 developers at places like Meta and Microsoft and supports 3 billion calls every year. The company raised $45 million at a $345 million valuation in April.
Celine Halioua
Ethan Pines for Forbes
Loyal
Founder:
Celine Halioua (CEO)
Equity raised:
$135 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$0
Lead investors:
Bain Capital Ventures, Collaborative Fund, First Round Capital, Khosla Ventures, Longevity Fund, Valor Equity Partners
Dogs don’t live long enough. Celine Halioua—an Oxford Ph.D. dropout and former chief of staff at the first VC firm focused on longevity-related biotechs—started San Francisco-based Loyal to develop drugs that could delay their aging by targeting metabolic and hormonal imbalances before they become disease. The company’s first beef-flavored longevity pill could hit the market by 2026, potentially extending dogs’ lives—and perhaps someday ours as well.

Amar Hanspal
Cody Pickens for Forbes
Motif
Founders:
Amar Hanspal (CEO), Brian Mathews
Equity raised:
$46 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$0
Lead investors:
CapitalG, Redpoint
Architects at some 20 firms use Amar Hanspal’s two-year-old software to design buildings and complex structures while collaborating with one another in real time. It’s like Figma, but for architects. The tool, trained on thousands of floor plans and public data, uses AI to generate 3D layouts after designers specify details like the number of conference rooms, ceiling heights and window placements. Before starting Motif, Hanspal, 61, did a 15-year stint at Autodesk, the construction industry’s $5.5 billion (2024 revenue) software incumbent. “People are designing intelligent buildings. We want to build an intelligence system that assists them,” he says.
Cameron McCord
Nominal
Nominal
Founders:
Jason Hoch, Cameron McCord (CEO), Bryce Strauss
Equity raised:
$102 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$5 million
Lead investors:
General Catalyst, Lux Capital, Sequoia Capital
Those who make planes, robots and drones want to move fast. But Cameron McCord, 35, an ex-Navy nuclear engineer who spent five years working at defense startups, believed they didn’t have the right tech to manage product testing. Nominal, which he cofounded in 2022, sells software that collects and analyzes the results of trials of aircraft and other hardware. Customers include the U.S. Air Force, Palmer Luckey’s drone outfit Anduril and seaplane developer Regent.
Adit Abraham
Reducto
Reducto
Founders:
Adit Abraham (CEO), Raunak Chowdhuri
Equity raised:
$33 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$1 million
Lead investors:
Benchmark, First Round Capital
MIT grads Adit Abraham, 26, and Raunak Chowdhuri, 23, named their startup Reducto after the Harry Potter spell that shatters objects. Their mission is a little tamer: Reducto’s AI software turns messy documents into clean, usable data. Similar to how a human would review paperwork, Reducto’s tech scans documents multiple times to catch and fix mistakes. So far, it has processed over 250 million pages for companies including Scale AI, Vanta and Airtable.
Misha Laskin
Reflection AI
Reflection AI
Founders:
Ioannis Antonoglou, Misha Laskin (CEO)
Equity raised:
$130 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$0
Lead investors:
CRV, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital
In 2016, Google DeepMind researcher Ioannis Antonoglou, now 37, helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to beat an elite human player at the board game Go. Eight years later, he teamed up with Laskin, 35, another former DeepMind researcher, to build Reflection AI, with the goal of building a “superintelligence” that can write and maintain code. Most AI coding companies are still focused on tools that help developers, but Reflection wants to fully replace them.
Gabriel Stengel
alexander karnyukhin for forbes
Rogo
Founders:
Tumas Rackaitis, Gabriel Stengel (CEO), John Willett
Equity raised:
$75 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$2 million
Lead investors:
AlleyCorp, Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital
New York City–based Rogo is building a chatbot to help junior bankers with time sucks like crunching numbers, preparing presentations and spreadsheets or doing basic research. Trained on financial data­sets from places like Crunchbase and FactSet, the tool is used by some 10,000 busy juniors at firms including Tiger Global to trim hours from their 90-hour workweeks, says Gabriel Stengel, 27. With Rogo automating the gruntwork, bankers will be able to focus on more strategic tasks and building relationships with clients, he adds.
Ishan Mukherjee
Rox
Rox
Founders:
Ishan Mukherjee (CEO), Avanika Narayan, Diogo Ribeiro, Shriram Sridharan
Equity raised:
$50 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$0
Lead investors:
General Catalyst, GV, Sequoia
Ishan Mukherjee, 37, a former Apple engineer, started Rox in 2024. The startup, headquartered in San Francisco, builds AI “agent swarms” that act like virtual assistants for sales teams—automating research, outreach and follow-ups so reps can focus on closing deals. Companies such as Ramp, MongoDB and Confluent are already using Rox to grow faster with fewer resources.

Stackblitz
Stackblitz
Founders:
Albert Pai, Eric Simons (CEO)
Equity raised:
$135 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$4 million
Lead investors:
Emergence, Greylock, GV, Insight
In 2024, Eric Simons, 34, was on the verge of shuttering Stackblitz. The startup simply couldn’t figure out how to make money from its browser-based coding tools. But when it embraced the “vibe co­ding” AI software craze, its product, Bolt, took off. It allows people to build apps just by typing in a description. The company’s customer base has surged to 5 million, with the company bringing in 85% of the year’s revenue in just four months.
John Hu
Ethan Pines for Forbes
Stan
Founders:
Vitalii Dodonov, John Hu (CEO)
Equity raised:
$5 million
Estimated 2024 revenue:
$25 million
Lead investor:
Forerunner Ventures
Having millions of followers online doesn’t immediately translate into a full-time salary. Stan tries to make it easier for those with online fame to cash in on their success with an online storefront linked to their social media profile. Stan, which claims to have achieved profitability after raising just $5 million from Forerunner Ventures back in 2022, provides an easy way for creators to sell their social media followers everything from personalized merch to coaching sessions.

The Asia-Pacific region is a center place for industrial products development as well as acquiring cost effective engineering services offered by highly skilled professionals and engineers. The region is also home to a number of well-known software outsourcing service firms.
Leading to price arbitrage, rising local outsourcing demand, and robust manufacturing bases in developing countries like China and India, the Asia-Pacific region dominates market growth. With a market share of more than 60%, Asia Pacific dominates the market for testing services. The primary forces behind this expansion are the outsourcing of IT test activities to smaller businesses and the rising demand for QA and QC services from MNCs.
Additionally, wealthy nations like the US, Japan, and Germany sometimes have relatively high labor costs. As a result, they preferred outsourcing their engineering services to countries like India, Indonesia, China, and Malaysia which are offshore and can offer good environment and skilled personnel at a reasonable price. India has the second-highest population in the world. India, which has a population of over 1.3 billion, has a sizable population of engineers and other technical professionals, who are highly sought after by multinational corporations. Due to India's strong engineering manpower, affordable labor, and global business ties, these corporations outsource engineering services to India.
The top three justifications for outsourcing engineering services to India are lower costs, higher service quality, and quicker time to market. Infosys Ltd., Wipro Ltd., and Tech Mahindra Ltd. are significant Indian businesses that contract with foreign nations to provide engineering services. China is the largest economy in the world and is a significant player in the market for outsourcing engineering services. More engineers are employed in China than in any other nation, and China also produces the majority of engineering graduates worldwide. The nation is a desirable supplier of engineering services due to its high levels of skill intensity.
One of the markets with the highest growth in the outsourcing of engineering services is the Asia-Pacific area. The Asia-Pacific region has become one of the most well-liked offshore outsourcing locations for producers and suppliers. Due to the accessibility of highly qualified engineers at affordable locations providing technologically advanced services, the presence of well-known software outsourcing service providers in the area can be credited for this increase. Additionally, the consumer electronics, telecom, and semiconductor industries—which are the main consumers of ESO services—are heavily concentrated in APAC.
The Asia-Pacific engineering services outsourcing industry is primarily driven by the growing local outsourcing demand, a strong manufacturing base, and cost arbitrage in developing nations like China and India. Both India and China have a sizable pool of engineering graduates at their disposal to assist with the functions of product design, process design, prototyping, testing, quality control, and reporting (India graduates over 400K engineering and comparable majors each year).
The Antitrust Guidelines for the Platform Economy were published by China's State Council in February 2021. According to the Chinese government, this move was taken in response to the growth of the digital economy to put an end to monopolistic behavior and encourage the long-term and healthy expansion of
e-commerce
. Engineering outsourcing jobs are expected to increase in the region as a result of the region's strong consumer electronics industries, improved government backing, and regulatory laws.

The cost reduction from lower labor wages will be a major driver for the growth of engineering services outsourcing market. Due to high cost of labor in developed and industrialized countries, companies are outsourcing their engineering processes to less expensive locations. The engineering services outsourcing allows businesses to delegate work to low-cost workforce while reducing costs associated with extra office space, labor, infrastructure, and operations. These benefits are predicted to drive engineering services outsourcing from high-cost labor countries to low-cost labor countries.
The rise of the engineering services outsourcing business, as well as the increasing usage of engineering service outsourcing, is mostly attributable to shorter product life cycles. Most business solutions are only available for a limited time, requiring resubscription or repurchase. A consumer may need to upgrade and modify their information technology infrastructure system after the contract expires, or an automobile original equipment manufacturer may require a new set of engines for an upcoming vehicle, necessitating ongoing technical upgrades.
The engineering services outsourcing company thrives as a result of the repeating nature of the services, which also increases demand for subsequent goods, moving the sector forward. When selecting an engineering service outsourcing provider, industry experience, previous initiatives, market value, and the quality of service it provides are all important aspects to consider. However, new entrants may find it difficult to break into the engineering services outsourcing market and establish a presence due to a lack of project infrastructure, business networks, and familiarity with client requirements.
One of the primary factors driving the engineering services outsourcing market’s growth is the increased adoption of integrated solutions for creating and evaluating engineering systems. Additionally, growing use of engineering systems such as computer aided engineering, electronic design automation software, computer aided manufacturing, and computer aided design software is fueling the engineering services outsourcing market expansion. These applications help to improve the overall efficiency of manufacturing operations and can be used on laptops, tablets, smartphones, and computers.
Other growth inducing variables include various technical developments and the introduction of digital transformational services. The original equipment manufacturers are integrating smart manufacturing systems, artificial intelligence, robotics solutions to better product detailing and modelling which is also boosting the engineering services outsourcing market.
Component Insights
As of 2024, the software segment was the highest contributor to this market, with USD 1,377.01 billion, and is anticipated to reach USD 7,396.56 billion by 2034, registering a CAGR of 18.10% from 2025 to 2034.
By component, the software segment accounted for the dominating share in 2024 in component segment and is also projected to be the fastest-growing segment over the forecast year. In the world of rapidly evolving technologies, a tremendous need for the development of cost-effective and high-quality solutions has been generated. Software outsourcing offers absolute services with the advantage of reduced costs and risks associated, enhanced efficiency, and improved security. The presence of existing market players and the introduction of emerging start-ups and new market players providing software outsourcing services are accelerating the growth of this segment.
All the prominent and small-scale U.S. and European companies are outsourcing vital technological tasks and are projected to raise outsourcing over the forecast period. This is attributed to the talent shortage that occurred in developed countries and they now rely on technology experts from other countries. For instance, as stated in an article published by Forbes Media LLC, in September 2022, a 4 million software developer shortage will be experienced by 2025, whereas the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that nearly 200,000 developer positions would be needed each year throughout the decade. On the other hand, high competition in the market, several offices shut down, and the lack of software engineers are eminent factors generating software outsourcing popularity; thereby bolstering the growth of this segment.
By component, the hardware segment is projected to grow exponentially over the forecast period. One of the major reasons for outsourcing a company’s hardware services is cost. This is attributed to the reduced need for hiring additional employees and extending the working hours of existing employees. This factor significantly bolsters the growth of the hardware segment. Another reason supporting the costcutting associated with hardware outsourcing is, it reduces the need for the procurement of software or IT equipment. In addition to this, better productivity, delivery of more efficient products or services, and reduced time periods are some other factors responsible for thriving the growth of this segment. Furthermore, designing complex hardware systems is most of the time a complex task for even big companies. Reduced efforts for the establishment and maintenance of hardware equipment are another factor escalating the growth of this segment.
Service Insights
In 2024, the testing segment has generated a revenue share of 31.64%. The necessity to build and modify product models with improved compatibility and bug free operations has fueled the testing segment’s growth in recent years. By service, the testing segment accounted for the largest revenue shareholder in 2023. Cost effectivity, testing efficiency, and access to a wide variety of testing procedures with an intervention of testing outsourcing are some of the prominent factors shaping the growth of the testing segment. In addition to this, another reason for outsourcing software testing is the availability of insufficient sources, and the internal team’s expertise related to testing is responsible for expanding the growth of this segment. Testing outsourcing being popular for its functionality, better performance, and extensive usability amps up the growth of this segment. On the other contrary, when a company wants to launch an application soon on which they have worked for several weeks and lacks skills, resources, and expertise for QA testing; outsourcing can conclusively help achieve the app launch within the deadline. This phenomenon further elevates the growth of this segment.

The designing segment is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 18.33% in the future years. This is attributed to increasing design complexity and the need to save costs by outsourcing design to a trained but relatively low-cost workforce. By service, the designing segment accounted for the fastest-growing segment over the forecast period. Design outsourcing has helped several firms across the globe to deliver continuous projects with additional variety and quality offerings. Access to a large number of talented designers and the extensive availability of their artistic approaches are some of the striking factors reinforcing the growth of the designing segment. The rising acceptance of outsourcing designing by the digital product development industry is augmenting the growth of this segment.
In addition to this, design outsourcing thoroughly saves the company’s operational costs as it doesn’t require setting up a standard workplace, purchasing essential equipment, and establishing an in-house design team. This is considered one of the key factors striking the growth of this segment. Moreover, time-saving attribute outsourcing design avails trained and experienced experts ready to perform designing tasks instead of spending time recruiting and training candidates to perform their work. This factor is projected to foster the growth of this segment.
Location Insights
In 2024, the onshore segment was valued at USD 1,232.76 billion. The onshore services refer to the provision of services to an original equipment manufacturer based in the same nation as the engineering services providers. The onshore outsourcing removes language barriers and improves communication between service providers and original equipment manufacturers, resulting in better service and product delivery.
The offshore segment, on the other hand, is predicted to develop at the quickest rate in the future years. The offshore services refer to the delivery of engineering services beyond international borders. Due to the worldwide inflation rates, training expenses, high churn rates, and an increasing preference for outsourcing to onshore partners, the offshore segment is expected to develop at a rapid pace.
Application Insights
The industrial segment has contributed more than 56.51% of revenue share in 2024. Through the adoption of private, public, and hybrid clouds, industrial products manufacturing businesses are modernizing their information technology infrastructure, driving automation, and streamlining obsolete processes. One of the main factors influencing the acceptance of engineering services outsourcing is likely to be the growing relationship between Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and Engineering Service Providers (ESP) (ESO). Key ESO industry actors have been encouraged by worldwide R&D activities to incorporate global delivery systems into their business strategies. Engineering service requirements have undergone a considerable shift in the market, moving from mechanical and non-core requirements to location-based core competencies.

The industrial sector currently has the largest share of the market, and it is projected that it will maintain this position during the forecast period. Digitalization is being adopted gradually by a variety of probing services, such as drilling, blasting, crushing, and tunnelling to implement commercial and public to upgrade their information technology-driven infrastructure, promote automation, and streamline inherited procedures. Industrial product hybrid cloud producers are heavily embracing cloud architecture. The industrial industry is expected to grow as a result of the industrial internet of things' ability to reduce downtimes, find and fix errors, and lower supervision costs.
The healthcare segment is expected to witness growth at a CAGR of around 19.15% over the forecast period. The extensive investments in laboratories, medical equipment, and drugs have contributed to the segment’s growth.
Aggressive investments in state-of-the-art medical technology, laboratories, and drugs can fuel the expansion of the healthcare sector. The healthcare business has specifically preferred the ESPs, especially in the last few months, to manufacture treatments and vaccinations that would erase the negative effects of coronavirus, thus they noted sustained growth in their sales. To enhance clinical capability and reduce operating expenses, healthcare organizations are increasingly working with ESPs. Various healthcare organizations are forming strategic partnerships with ESPs to broaden their market reach and provide advantages that will improve the client-contractor relationship.
Many businesses view outsourcing as a secure way to access the low-cost offshore market. One of the most frequently outsourced design services is new product development, sometimes known as R&D. Presenting a notion to a team of highly skilled engineers and allowing them to develop it into useful end goods is the process of research and development. Hospitals are increasingly contracting out internal tasks to outside service companies, including IT and medical billing. Due to a lack of industry knowledge and experienced resources, hospitals are increasingly outsourcing medical billing and IT services to outside service providers. Additionally, the implementation of rules and the accreditation of service providers hold them responsible for upholding their quality standards.
Big data analytics has experienced rapid growth and has begun to play a significant role in the advancement of medical care procedures and academic research. It provides tools for gathering, managing, analyzing, and absorbing huge amounts of fragmented, unstructured, and structured data generated by existing healthcare systems.

min read
Engineering services represent roughly
$262 billion in annual revenue
in the US alone, according to the US Department of Commerce’s Select USA program. More than 75,000 firms contribute to this market. Even though there are a few industry giants, IBISWorld reports that not even the top engineering firms have more than a
5% market share
.
There are four main branches of engineering—civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical—with many large firms providing services in more than one area. Because engineering goes hand-in-hand with architecture and construction, the biggest engineering firms often have full-scale architecture and construction divisions.
Below, we’ve listed 30 of the top engineering firms in the US, based on revenue figures reported by
ZoomInfo
. This list represents firms that focus primarily on engineering versus the larger full-service conglomerates. We looked at the

What Makes a Billion-Dollar Engineering Firm?
Scaling to a billion dollars isn’t easy. Aside from the five firms that we looked at above, only 13 others on this list have reached more than 10% of this goal. And there are 75,000 more organizations trying to secure a bigger market share.
So what can other high-growth firms learn from these billion-dollar giants on their quest to scale?
It takes a global footprint.
All of these firms operate in more than one country. In fact, three out of the top five don’t even have their headquarters in the US. Although the US engineering services market is healthy and represents roughly 30% of the total, the
global market opportunity
is three times bigger.
Offer multiple service lines.
One thing is clear from the top five engineering firms on this list—you can’t grow to a billion dollars by specializing in one service line. They all offer an array of capabilities across numerous sectors. If your firm’s project portfolio is concentrated in one or two areas of specialty, or your clients are all in the same industry, consider diversifying services.
Constant innovation is non-negotiable.
Innovation is essential for any business trying to gain a competitive advantage, but it’s particularly important for engineering firms. Engineers are the world’s biggest problem-solvers. Because the world is constantly evolving, so too are the challenges we face. If you want to be the best in class, you must be committed to continually finding new and better solutions.
Technology is a key differentiator.
The top engineering firms lead with a
technology-centric approach
. This isn’t just about technical consulting. It’s also about what technologies are powering your organization. The best firms use technology like
business intelligence tools
and
resource management software
to build more scalable, intelligent, and profitable organizations.
The future for the global engineering services market is bright. It’s expected to reach
$2 trillion by 2026
. With the right recipe and approach, there are still plenty of opportunities for up-and-coming firms to secure their positions as top engineering companies.

Project Details
About the project
America’s Best Employers for Engineers are identified in an independent survey from a vast sample of over 28,000 U.S. employees working for companies employing at least 1,000 people within the U.S.The survey was conducted using several online access panels, providing a representative sample of engineers in the American workforce. Each engineers was asked which firm or institution he or she works for in an open-ended question with an autofill option.
Scoring
The scoring in our evaluation
Our scoring model is based on independently collected survey data from employees in the US. This data is divided into several assessment dimensions.
Direct score
On a scale of 0 to 10, respondents indicate how likely they are to recommend their own employer to friends or family – with 0 being the worst and 10 the best.
Indirect score
Respondents indicate the industry they work in. Based on this, each respondent is shown a selection of employers who are active in the given sector. Respondents can then voluntarily recommend or advise against employers from the list.
METHODOLOGY

Engineering Services in the US industry analysis
Technological integration, governmental infrastructure investment and a focus on sustainability are driving a period of transformation for engineering services. In 2025, the industry boasts an annual revenue of $350.8 billion, with a current-year growth rate of 1.0% and steady profit. This uptick in revenue and profit stability is mainly because of the adoption of new technologies like building information modeling (BIM) and 3D printing, which have streamlined operations and reduced costs. Substantial government investments, accounting for 34.4% of industry revenue, have provided a stable foundation for growth. However, interest rate fluctuations and growing demands for sustainable practices introduce challenges engineers must navigate to maintain momentum.
Trends and Insights
Interest rate fluctuations significantly impact engineering services revenue volatility.
High rates and inflation have depressed demand, but with anticipated rate cuts, construction activity and industry revenue are expected to recover.
Major legislation’s boosting engineering projects.
With landmark laws like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, there’s now a flood of funds driving demand in sectors like manufacturing and transportation. However, heightened labor competition could inflate costs.
The Southeast's booming economy is a magnet for engineering services.
With states like Florida and Virginia leading the charge, businesses are drawn to its large population, low taxes and growing infrastructure needs. This growth creates a wealth of opportunities.
Start-up hurdles in the engineering services industry are formidable, with hefty costs and legal complexities at the forefront.
Navigating these barriers requires significant funding and regulatory knowledge, without which entrants might struggle early on.

1.     The engineering workforce – capacity and capability
Size – there is clearly a shortage of engineers in Australia across most sectors and disciplines. The future strength of the economy will determine how many more engineers it needs and can absorb. The perfect solution would be to inject more people into every stage of the pipeline of engineer development from early school years through to keeping more engineers who are nearing retirement in the workforce for longer.
Greatest demand – the cohort of engineers in highest demand seem to be experienced and “capable” engineers with ~10 years+ experience. I need to emphasise “capable” here because it’s a strong theme (one direct quote – “There is strong competition for the capable engineers”. Another – “on paper all the applicants looked great. In practice, their competence was significantly lacking”.) The workforce needs engineers who know their stuff, who can get things done, and who can lead teams to solve actual problems. High levels of churn in the workforce, a decline in internships and grad programs (that is showing strong signs of recovering) and perhaps insufficient attention in providing professional development opportunities for engineers are contributing factors. There is a strong link here with engineering education (#3 below).
Composition – with only around 40% of the Australian engineering workforce being Australian-born, and 3.8% of the engineering workforce here Australian-born women, we desperately need to encourage more young Australians to choose to study then work in engineering. The three critical factors here are – (1) raised awareness within the community of what engineering is, what engineers do, and the incredibly wide range of fulfilling careers engineers can have (I describe it as a ‘choose your own adventure’ type of career) (2) improved standards of maths education in Australia and more students studying intermediate and advanced level maths (3) reduced gender biases in STEM education
Retention – we lose so many engineering students and qualified engineers to other parts of the economy (for positive and negative reasons. Part of the positive is that engineers have a versatile skillset and mindset with their quantitative analysis and problem solving and design skills that are valued everywhere). Therefore substantial improvement in supportive and inclusive learning and work places are required in all its facets. There are so many elements to this but if I had to choose the top four they would be (1) removal of unconscious and conscious bias in all aspects of work (2) mentors for students and engineers at all career stages (3) more work experience and internship opportunities for school and uni students, and grad programs for graduates and (4) more focused effort on providing professional development opportunities for engineers so they can accumulate more experience (and hence insight) and are more likely to see a rewarding career path in engineering.
Skilled migrants – only around half of our overseas-born engineers are employed in engineering roles. Engineers Australia’s research showed that there were seven main barriers to workforce participation of skilled migrants, but it should be said that conscious and unconscious bias plays a big part, possibly the biggest part, and we all need to be mindful and actively working on this.
2.
Keeping up with the dynamic nature of work
. There are many aspects to this but among the most challenging I think will be for the engineering profession to establish and demonstrate the
integrity
of (relatively) emerging technologies such as AI, digitisation and data analytics.
3.
Engineering Education
- generally speaking Australia trains engineers well,  (engineers have topped the Australian Government’s Employer Satisfaction Survey (ESS) for the last three years) and where I have seen strong and effective university-industry links, such as in work-integrated learning, capstone projects and other extra-curricular opportunities, in my view, these programs are responsible for producing exceptionally good engineering graduates. Scaling this up is a significant opportunity and the key focus area for the Australian Council of Engineering Deans (ACED) Engineering Futures 2035 project.
4.
Design standards and codes
– many design standards and codes are not being reviewed and updated frequently enough to account for changing operational conditions due to a changing climate and changing footprints and frequency of extreme weather events. Many of these require the contribution and coordination of voluntary effort of subject matter experts.
5.
Innovation and entrepreneurship
- as is often lamented, Australia’s commercialisation environment thwarts a thriving innovation economy. In some sectors procurement systems stifle engineering innovation and in a subset of these procurement and contractual arrangements stifle more than innovation – by undermining fundamental acceptable outcomes.
6.
Complexity
– engineering work is becoming increasingly complex. Engineers must now be accountable for engineering work at the component, assembly or module, sub-system, system and system-of-systems levels. Mega-projects will continue to grow, including mega-city development, the mass movement of people and urbanisation, energy systems, communications networks, mega data sets and mega-infrastructure projects. Greater focus on, and skills development for the system-of-systems level of engineering work will be needed to appropriately manage system-of-system performance and interdependencies and cascading risk of critical infrastructure and systems in an increasingly uncertain strategic and operating environment.
7.
Climate change
– engineers will need to become more impactful and influential to ensure the technical perspective is appropriately considered in policy and decision making relating to climate change. Engineers will need to upskill in areas of climate change mitigation (embedded and operational emissions), adaptation, resilience, biodiversity, and circularity.

8.
Crisis management
– engineers should play an increasingly important role in the coordination of crisis management and response, reconstruction & recovery. As the cost of the aftermath of extreme weather events and other crises continues to accumulate, engineers will need to make the case for building in adaptation or resilience measures in to engineering work.
9.
Trust in the profession
- I have observed first hand and have had numerous conversations with senior engineers across many sectors, that the engineering perspective is not always considered a critical input into many important decisions. This will continue to be a challenge for the engineering profession (and for professions more generally). Part of the onus is on engineers to improve communication (e.g. refrain from overwhelming people with the technical detail). The other part is for others from different backgrounds to recognise when the engineering perspective is needed, and, importantly that the engineering perspective is grounded in centuries of mathematical and scientific knowledge combined with the ever-evolving body of knowledge on engineering methods – and, even though as a general rule, multiple perspectives are needed to successfully grapple with complex challenges, dismissing or inadequately considering the technical or engineering perspective can have consequences that range from suboptimal to catastrophic (see also below).
10.
Professional standards
– the quality of engineering work, which comprises the ethics of an engineer, the competency of the engineer and the value that an engineer (or engineering team) delivers in their work, matters more than ever, for four main reasons:
Public and worker health and safety depends on the integrity of engineering work in almost every aspect of our daily lives.
The quality of engineering work has a huge impact on the economy, from the cost of rework through to how well engineering systems deliver their intended outcomes.
Australian engineers need to be educated and trained to work to internationally agreed engineering education and competency standards to ensure engineers are professionally mobile, to ensure that supply and demand imbalances can be evened out across the world, and to ensure that cross-fertilisation of ideas for innovation and sharing of best practice occurs, and finally...
For many aspects of engineering work there is a time imperative and a sense of urgency. This is true for the notion that time-is-money but it is also true, now, for all climate change related objectives.
At times there can be pressures that threaten to weaken how professional standards are upheld. These should be considered carefully, for the potential four consequences outlined above.
Engineering is a wonderfully diverse, highly dynamic and important profession that impacts almost all aspects of our current and future lives. We need more of them and we need them educated and trained well to ensure they contribute what is needed to meet some of humanity and the planet's most important challenges and opportunities.

To improve the performance of Professional Engineers across all age groups we could change our current hire and fire on a project basis to hire and mentor/train on a longer term multi project basis like in the old days up to about thirty years ago. The mentoring would be done in house and the training could be done in house and/or via EA and other outside training programs to suit the situation with the particular engineering company involved.

An interesting dimension is that many Engineers in Australia have experience of modification and sustainment of existing systems but far fewer have experience of equipment or system design. A large proportion of technology is imported and refined for a local configuration and environment. This limited contribution to the value chain means engineers have difficulty building a sustainable competitive advantage of Australian technology for export.

It’s a fair list.
It addresses most of the touchpoints and platitudes expected.
But as a former, long term IEAust and IChemE member who resigned both memberships some years ago (after the UK ethics debacle) I see little address of these highlights by either institution or industry generally.  At least it’s piecemeal.
It’s the same issues that were identified decades ago.
Meanwhile many of our processing staples (remember all the refining operations, mines and production plants being mothballed?) are disappearing and value added to primary production is sparce.
We remain horribly ‘extract it and ship it’s driven.
I’m not sensing a robust strategic plan to address assertively many of the items on this list nor much beyond the usual bluster about memberships, chartering, and awards agrandisement.
Some glimmers appear….occasionally.
Mentoring (which I have been involved with) has improved… a bit.
While there are more ‘engineering’ courses popping up, my experience is that  quality and fundamentals are suffering.
I personally know many highly experienced engineers who have effectively left the profession or become dismayed.
Any innovative pragmatic solutions?

The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with the market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden market growth reflected by the rise in CAGR is attributable to the market’s growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, engineering services were badly affected, resulting in many projects being delayed and budgets being cut. With demand decreased due to lockdowns and economic troubles, many companies chose to cut back on new projects. When supply disruptions slowed engineering work, it caused the market decline to continue. Collaborative projects in engineering were difficult because remote work was limited due to challenges. As a consequence, the market saw a big decrease in its revenue and potential for growth during the pandemic.
LATEST TRENDS
Digital twins boost market growth by enabling predictive maintenance and improving efficiency across engineering and operations
Digital twin technology is leading a major shift in the engineering services market. Using AI and up-to-date data, digital twins can now support predictive maintenance, make systems more effective, and help reduce costs in fields including manufacturing, healthcare, and urban planning. In Europe, nearly 70% of construction companies use Building Information Modeling (BIM) to update designs instantly and estimate building material costs. The growth of cloud-based digital twins and DTaaS supports more SMEs to benefit from this trend. With digital twins now becoming enterprise-wide systems, they are crucial for making decisions that tie together engineering, operations, and business departments.
